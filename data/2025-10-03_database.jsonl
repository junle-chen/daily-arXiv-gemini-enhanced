However,\nPK data are often embedded in complex, heterogeneous tables with variable\nstructures and inconsistent terminologies, posing significant challenges for\nautomated PK data retrieval and standardization. AutoPK, a novel two-stage\nframework for accurate and scalable extraction of PK data from complex\nscientific tables. In the first stage, AutoPK identifies and extracts PK\nparameter variants using large language models (LLMs), a hybrid similarity\nmetric, and LLM-based validation. The second stage filters relevant rows,\nconverts the table into a key-value text format, and uses an LLM to reconstruct\na standardized table. Evaluated on a real-world dataset of 605 PK tables,\nincluding captions and footnotes, AutoPK shows significant improvements in\nprecision and recall over direct LLM baselines. For instance, AutoPK with LLaMA\n3.1-70B achieved an F1-score of 0.92 on half-life and 0.91 on clearance\nparameters, outperforming direct use of LLaMA 3.1-70B by margins of 0.10 and\n0.21, respectively. Smaller models such as Gemma 3-27B and Phi 3-12B with\nAutoPK achieved 2-7 fold F1 gains over their direct use, with Gemma's\nhallucination rates reduced from 60-95% down to 8-14%. Notably, AutoPK enabled\nopen-source models like Gemma 3-27B to outperform commercial systems such as\nGPT-4o Mini on several PK parameters. AutoPK enables scalable and\nhigh-confidence PK data extraction, making it well-suited for critical\napplications in veterinary pharmacology, drug safety monitoring, and public\nhealth decision-making, while addressing heterogeneous table structures and\nterminology and demonstrating generalizability across key PK parameters.

Organising over one hundred metrics and Key Performance Indicators\n(KPIs) into four subclusters (Fundamental, Contextual, Resolution, and\nSpecialised) within the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) framework, the taxonomy\nintegrates both universal and domain-specific quality dimensions. By\npositioning data quality as a strategic connector across the BSC's Financial,\nCustomer, Internal Processes, and Learning & Growth perspectives, it\ndemonstrates how quality metrics underpin valuation accuracy, customer trust,\noperational efficiency, and innovation capacity. The framework's interconnected\n\"metrics layer\" ensures that improvements in one dimension cascade into others,\nmaximising strategic impact. This holistic approach bridges the gap between\ngranular technical assessment and high-level decision-making, offering\npractitioners, data stewards, and strategists a scalable, evidence-based\nreference for aligning data quality management with sustainable value creation."}

These manual efforts limit scalability,\nreproducibility, and cross-institutional generalization. To address this, we\nintroduce EMR-AGENT (Automated Generalized Extraction and Navigation Tool), an\nagent-based framework that replaces manual rule writing with dynamic, language\nmodel-driven interaction to extract and standardize structured clinical data.\nOur framework automates cohort selection, feature extraction, and code mapping\nthrough interactive querying of databases. Our modular agents iteratively\nobserve query results and reason over schema and documentation, using SQL not\njust for data retrieval but also as a tool for database observation and\ndecision making. This eliminates the need for hand-crafted, schema-specific\nlogic. To enable rigorous evaluation, we develop a benchmarking codebase for\nthree EMR databases (MIMIC-III, eICU, SICdb), including both seen and unseen\nschema settings. Our results demonstrate strong performance and generalization\nacross these databases, highlighting the feasibility of automating a process\npreviously thought to require expert-driven design.

However, exact computations of these metrics are known to be\nNP-Hard. Recent neural network-based approaches approximate the similarity\nscore in embedding spaces to alleviate the computational burden, but they\neither involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively\nutilize structural and scale information of graphs. To tackle these issues, we\npropose a novel geometric-based graph embedding method called Graph2Region\n(G2R). G2R represents nodes as closed regions and recovers their adjacency\npatterns within graphs in the embedding space. By incorporating the node\nfeatures and adjacency patterns of graphs, G2R summarizes graph regions, i.e.,\ngraph embeddings, where the shape captures the underlying graph structures and\nthe volume reflects the graph size. Consequently, the overlap between graph\nregions can serve as an approximation of MCS, signifying similar node regions\nand adjacency patterns. We further analyze the relationship between MCS and GED\nand propose using disjoint parts as a proxy for GED similarity. This analysis\nenables concurrent computation of MCS and GED, incorporating local and global\nstructural information. Experimental evaluation highlights G2R's competitive\nperformance in graph similarity computation. It achieves up to a 60.0\\%\nrelative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity\nlearning, while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference.\nMoreover, G2R showcases remarkable capability in predicting both MCS and GED\nsimilarities simultaneously, providing a holistic assessment of graph\nsimilarity.
