However, this multi-stage process is\nprone to cumulative errors, introduces high latency, and yields weak coupling\nbetween semantics and control. These limitations call for a more direct pathway\nfrom language to action, one that eliminates fragile intermediate stages.\nTherefore, we present RoboGhost, a retargeting-free framework that directly\nconditions humanoid policies on language-grounded motion latents. By bypassing\nexplicit motion decoding and retargeting, RoboGhost enables a diffusion-based\npolicy to denoise executable actions directly from noise, preserving semantic\nintent and supporting fast, reactive control. A hybrid causal\ntransformer-diffusion motion generator further ensures long-horizon consistency\nwhile maintaining stability and diversity, yielding rich latent representations\nfor precise humanoid behavior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboGhost\nsubstantially reduces deployment latency, improves success rates and tracking\naccuracy, and produces smooth, semantically aligned locomotion on real\nhumanoids.

The connection to trajectory prediction is weaker, but the generation of motion sequences can be seen as a form of trajectory planning/control.", "keywords": ["humanoid locomotion", "language-guided", "diffusion model", "transformer"]}}
