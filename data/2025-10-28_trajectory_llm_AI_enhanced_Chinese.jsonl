To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph\n(KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane\narchitecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware\n``worldviews\" and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics\nfrom a domain-agnostic planner. This allows complex, coordinated paths to be\nmodified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous\nUnderwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the\nend-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative\npolicies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes. This work establishes the\nKG not merely as a data repository, but as a powerful, stateful orchestrator\nfor creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "This paper discusses multi-agent path planning in dynamic environments using a knowledge graph. While it doesn't directly use large language models, the use of a knowledge graph for path planning and coordination has some overlap with the reasoning capabilities that LLMs might provide. The core focus is on path planning, making it relevant to trajectory prediction. The connection to large language models is weaker but present due to the knowledge representation and reasoning aspects.", "keywords": ["multi-agent path planning", "dynamic environments", "knowledge graph", "path planning", "autonomous agents"]}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}
