While LIs achieve remarkable\nefficiency for static datasets, their performance degrades under dynamic\nupdates: maintaining the CDF invariant (sum of F(k) equals 1) requires global\nmodel retraining, which blocks queries and limits the queries-per-second (QPS)\nmetric. Current approaches fail to address these retraining costs effectively,\nrendering them unsuitable for real-world workloads with frequent updates. In\nthis paper, we present Sig2Model, an efficient and adaptive learned index that\nminimizes retraining cost through three key techniques: (1) a sigmoid boosting\napproximation technique that dynamically adjusts the index model by\napproximating update-induced shifts in data distribution with localized sigmoid\nfunctions while preserving bounded error guarantees and deferring full\nretraining; (2) proactive update training via Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)\nthat identifies high-update-probability regions for strategic placeholder\nallocation to speed up updates; and (3) a neural joint optimization framework\nthat continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters via\ngradient-based learning. We evaluate Sig2Model against state-of-the-art\nupdatable learned indexes on real-world and synthetic workloads, and show that\nSig2Model reduces retraining cost by up to 20x, achieves up to 3x higher QPS,\nand uses up to 1000x less memory."}
