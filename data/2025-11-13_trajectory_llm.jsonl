Videos, including those of humans or teleoperated robots, capture rich physical interactions. However, most of them lack labeled actions, which limits their use in robot learning. We present Video Prediction for Robot Actions (ViPRA), a simple pretraining-finetuning framework that learns continuous robot control from these actionless videos. Instead of directly predicting actions, we train a video-language model to predict both future visual observations and motion-centric latent actions, which serve as intermediate representations of scene dynamics. We train these latent actions using perceptual losses and optical flow consistency to ensure they reflect physically grounded behavior. For downstream control, we introduce a chunked flow matching decoder that maps latent actions to robot-specific continuous action sequences, using only 100 to 200 teleoperated demonstrations. This approach avoids expensive action annotation, supports generalization across embodiments, and enables smooth, high-frequency continuous control upto 22 Hz via chunked action decoding. Unlike prior latent action works that treat pretraining as autoregressive policy learning, explicitly models both what changes and how.

Despite their success in open-loop evaluations, these systems often exhibit significant performance degradation in closed-loop scenarios due to causal confusion. This confusion is fundamentally exacerbated by the overreliance of the imitation learning paradigm on expert trajectories, which often contain unattributable noise and interfere with the modeling of causal relationships between environmental contexts and appropriate driving actions.\n  To address this fundamental limitation, we propose Perception-Guided Self-Supervision (PGS) - a simple yet effective training paradigm that leverages perception outputs as the primary supervisory signals, explicitly modeling causal relationships in decision-making. The proposed framework aligns both the inputs and outputs of the decision-making module with perception results, such as lane centerlines and the predicted motions of surrounding agents, by introducing positive and negative self-supervision for the ego trajectory. This alignment is specifically designed to mitigate causal confusion arising from the inherent noise in expert trajectories.\n  Equipped with perception-driven supervision, our method, built on a standard end-to-end architecture, achieves a Driving Score of 78.08 and a mean success rate of 48.64% on the challenging closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods, including those employing more complex network architectures and inference pipelines. These results underscore the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed PGS framework and point to a promising direction for addressing causal confusion and enhancing real-world generalization in autonomous driving.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u6d89\u53ca\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u8f66\u8f86\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fego trajectory\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002 \u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u63d0\u5230\u4e86\"predicted motions of surrounding agents\"\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c5e\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8303\u7574\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u5230\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46end-to-end autonomous driving systems\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "keywords": ["trajectory prediction", "autonomous driving", "motion prediction", "ego trajectory", "perception"]}}

However, extending these methods to quadruped robots remains challenging due to their distinct and highly dynamic motion patterns. Models that perform well on pedestrian data often experience severe degradation when deployed on legged platforms. To tackle this challenge, we introduce X-IONet, a cross-platform inertial odometry framework that operates solely using a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). X-IONet incorporates a rule-based expert selection module to classify motion platforms and route IMU sequences to platform-specific expert networks. The displacement prediction network features a dual-stage attention architecture that jointly models long-range temporal dependencies and inter-axis correlations, enabling accurate motion representation. It outputs both displacement and associated uncertainty, which are further fused through an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for robust state estimation. Extensive experiments on public pedestrian datasets and a self-collected quadruped robot dataset demonstrate that X-IONet achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by 14.3% and Relative Trajectory Error (RTE) by 11.4% on pedestrian data, and by 52.8% and 41.3% on quadruped robot data. These results highlight the effectiveness of X-IONet in advancing accurate and robust inertial navigation across both human and legged robot platforms.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "This paper focuses on inertial odometry, specifically improving the accuracy of trajectory estimation using IMU data. While it doesn't directly involve Large Language Models, it is related to trajectory prediction for different platforms (pedestrians and quadruped robots). The core contribution is a novel network architecture for processing IMU data to predict displacement and estimate the trajectory. Therefore, the relevance is moderate.", "keywords": ["inertial odometry", "trajectory error", "pedestrian navigation", "trajectory estimation", "IMU", "motion prediction"]}}
