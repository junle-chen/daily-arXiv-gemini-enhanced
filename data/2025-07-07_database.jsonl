Existing\nautomated integration methods, such as Full Disjunction (FD)-based models like\nALITE, prioritize completeness but result in schema bloat, sparse attributes\nand limited business usability. We propose a novel hybrid, template-based\nschema matcher that aligns multi-layout tenancy schedules to a predefined\ntarget schema. The matcher combines schema (Jaccard, Levenshtein) and\ninstance-based metrics (data types, distributions) with globally optimal\nassignments determined via the Hungarian Algorithm. Evaluation against a\nmanually labeled ground truth demonstrates substantial improvements, with grid\nsearch optimization yielding a peak F1-score of 0.881 and an overall null\npercentage of 45.7%. On a separate ground truth of 20 semantically similar\ncolumn sets, ALITE achieves an F1-score of 0.712 and 75.6% nulls. These results\nsuggest that combining structured business knowledge with hybrid matching can\nyield more usable and business-aligned schema mappings. The approach assumes\ncleanly extracted tabular input, future work could explore extending the\nmatcher to support complex, composite tables."}
