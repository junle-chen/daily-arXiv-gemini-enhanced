Here, distributional similarity that captures similarity from\nactivity co-occurrences is commonly employed.

To\nunderpin our call for simple embeddings, we contribute a comprehensive\nbenchmarking framework, which includes means to assess the intrinsic quality of\nembeddings, their performance in downstream applications, and their\ncomputational efficiency.

In effect, such architectures state how the database records and\nlinks (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical\nexpression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it\nhard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available\ndata to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for\nexplaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where\nexplanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database\nthat mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global\nabductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash,\nSegoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between\ndeterminacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of\ngranularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones\nhighlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of\ntuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case\nof hetero-GNNs. We develop heuristic algorithms that avoid the exhaustive\nsearch over the space of all databases. We propose techniques that are\nmodel-agnostic, and others that are tailored to hetero-GNNs via the notion of\nlearnable masking. Our approach is evaluated through an extensive empirical\nstudy on the RelBench collection, covering a variety of domains and different\nrecord-level tasks.
