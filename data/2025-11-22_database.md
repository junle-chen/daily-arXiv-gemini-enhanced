Abstract: Even as AI capabilities improve, most enterprises do not consider agents trustworthy enough to work on production data. In this paper, we argue that the path to trustworthy agentic workflows begins with solving the infrastructure problem first: traditional lakehouses are not suited for agent access patterns, but if we design one around transactions, governance follows. In particular, we draw an operational analogy to MVCC in databases and show why a direct transplant fails in a decoupled, multi-language setting. We then propose an agent-first design, Bauplan, that reimplements data and compute isolation in the lakehouse. We conclude by sharing a reference implementation of a self-healing pipeline in Bauplan, which seamlessly couples agent reasoning with all the desired guarantees for correctness and trust.

Abstract: 与关系数据库交互对不同专业水平的用户来说仍然具有挑战性，特别是在编写复杂的分析查询或执行管理任务时。现有的系统通常只关注自然语言查询或数据库管理的狭窄方面，缺乏一个统一的、智能的界面来进行通用数据库交互。我们介绍了AskDB，一个由大型语言模型驱动的Agent，旨在通过自然语言支持SQL数据库上的数据分析和管理操作，从而弥合这一差距。AskDB建立在Gemini 2之上，集成了两项关键创新：一种动态的、模式感知的提示机制，可以有效地整合数据库元数据；以及一个任务分解框架，使Agent能够计划和执行多步骤操作。这些能力使AskDB能够自主调试派生的SQL，通过实时网络搜索检索上下文信息，并自适应地改进其响应。我们在广泛使用的Text-to-SQL基准和一个精心策划的DBA任务集上评估了AskDB，证明了其在分析和管理场景中的强大性能。我们的结果突显了AskDB作为关系数据库系统的统一和智能Agent的潜力，为终端用户提供了直观和可访问的体验。

Abstract: Table Extraction (TE) consists in extracting tables from PDF documents, in a structured format which can be automatically processed. While numerous TE tools exist, the variety of methods and techniques makes it difficult for users to choose an appropriate one. We propose a novel benchmark for assessing end-to-end TE methods (from PDF to the final table). We contribute an analysis of TE evaluation metrics, and the design of a rigorous evaluation process, which allows scoring each TE sub-task as well as end-to-end TE, and captures model uncertainty. Along with a prior dataset, our benchmark comprises two new heterogeneous datasets of 37k samples. We run our benchmark on diverse models, including off-the-shelf libraries, software tools, large vision language models, and approaches based on computer vision. The results demonstrate that TE remains challenging: current methods suffer from a lack of generalizability when facing heterogeneous data, and from limitations in robustness and interpretability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on Key-Value (KV) cache to reduce time- to-first-token (TTFT) latency, but existing disk-based KV cache systems using file-per-object layouts suffer from severe scalability bottlenecks due to file system metadata overhead, I/O inefficiency, and poor spatial locality. This paper presents SGLANG-LSM, a database-inspired system that leverages Log-Structured Merge- tree (LSM-tree) architectures for scalable KV cache management. SGLANG-LSM implements a layered system design with three coordinated components: (1) a prefix-preserving storage engine that maintains token sequence locality while efficiently storing large KV cache tensors through key-value separation, (2) an adaptive controller that dynamically optimizes LSM-tree configurations based on shifting workload characteristics, and (3) runtime services including batch opera- tions and automatic resource management for production deployment. Evaluation on large-scale dynamic workloads demonstrates that SGLANG-LSM significantly improves cache hits by up to 143% and reduces TTFT by up to 24% compared to state-of-the-art systems, representing the first systematic application of database storage architectures to large-scale LLM cache management.

Abstract: In this work, we present web scraping techniques to extract in- formation from patent tables, clean and structure them for future use in predictive machine learning models to develop new glasses. We extracted compositions and three properties relevant to the development of new glasses and structured them into a database to be used together with information from other available datasets. We also analyzed the consistency of the information obtained and what it adds to the existing databases. The extracted liquidus temperatures comprise 5,696 compositions; the second subset includes 4,298 refractive indexes and, finally, 1,771 compositions with Abbe numbers. The extraction performed here increases the available information by approximately 10.4% for liquidus temperature, 6.6% for refractive index, and 4.9% for Abbe number. The impact extends beyond quantity: the newly extracted data introduce compositions with property values that are more diverse than those in existing databases, thereby expanding the accessible compositional and property space for glass modeling applications. We emphasize that the compositions of the new database contain relatively more titanium, magnesium, zirconium, niobium, iron, tin, and yttrium oxides than those of the existing bases.

Abstract: Unreliable cardinality estimation remains a critical performance bottleneck in database management systems (DBMSs). Adaptive Query Processing (AQP) strategies address this limitation by providing a more robust query execution mechanism. Specifically, plan-based AQP achieves this by incrementally refining cardinality using feedback from the execution of sub-plans. However, the actual reason behind the improvements of plan-based AQP, especially across different storage architectures (on-disk vs. in-memory DBMSs), remains unexplored.   This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art plan-based AQP. We implement and evaluate this strategy on both on-disk and in-memory DBMSs across two benchmarks. Our key findings reveal that while plan-based AQP provides overall speedups in both environments, the sources of improvement differ significantly. In the on-disk DBMS, PostgreSQL, performance gains primarily come from the query plan reorderings, but not the cardinality updating mechanism; in fact, updating cardinalities introduces measurable overhead. Conversely, in the in-memory DBMS, DuckDB, cardinality refinement drives significant performance improvements for most queries. We also observe significant performance benefits of the plan-based AQP compared to a state-of-the-art related-based AQP method. These observations provide crucial insights for researchers on when and why plan-based AQP is effective, and ultimately guide database system developers on the tradeoffs between the implementation effort and performance improvements.
