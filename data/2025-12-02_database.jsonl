However, these ethical rules may vary according to the situation-the context-in which the application programs must work. In this paper, after reviewing the basic ethical concepts and their possible influence on data management, we propose a bipartite conceptual model, composed of the Context Dimensions Tree (CDT), which describes the possible contexts, and the Ethical Requirements Tree (ERT), representing the ethical rules necessary to tailor and preprocess the datasets that should be fed to Data Analysis and Learning Systems in each possible context. We provide some examples and suggestions on how these conceptual tools can be used."}

Their exact computation, however, is intractable because it requires aggregating marginal contributions over exponentially many permutations or subsets. While sampling-based estimators have been studied in cooperative game theory, their direct use for relational query answering remains underexplored and often ignores the structure of schemas and joins.\n  We study tuple-level attribution for relational queries through sampling and introduce Relation-Stratified Sampling (RSS). Instead of stratifying coalitions only by size, RSS partitions the sample space by a relation-wise count vector that records how many tuples are drawn from each relation. This join-aware stratification concentrates samples on structurally valid and informative coalitions and avoids strata that cannot satisfy query conditions. We further develop an adaptive variant, ARSS, that reallocates budget across strata using variance estimates obtained during sampling, improving estimator efficiency without increasing the total number of samples. We analyze these estimators, describe a practical implementation that reuses compiled views to reduce per-sample query cost, and evaluate them on TPCH workloads.\n  Across diverse queries with multi-relation joins and aggregates, RSS and ARSS consistently outperform classical Monte Carlo (MCS) and size-based Stratified Sampling (SS), yielding lower error and variance with fewer samples. An ablation shows that relation-aware stratification and adaptive allocation contribute complementary gains, making ARSS a simple, effective, and anytime estimator for database-centric Shapley attribution."}

Recent studies indicate that distributed databases exhibit significantly higher latency than single-node databases, primarily due to consensus protocols maintaining data consistency across multiple nodes. We argue that synchronization cost constitutes the primary bottleneck for distributed databases, which is particularly pronounced in wide-area networks (WAN). Fortunately, we identify opportunities to optimize synchronization costs in real production environments: (1) network clustering phenomena, (2) triangle inequality violations in transmission, and (3) redundant data transfers. Based on these observations, we propose GeoCoCo, a synchronization acceleration framework for cross-region distributed databases. First, GeoCoCo presents a group rescheduling strategy that adapts to real-time network conditions to maximize WAN transmission efficiency. Second, GeoCoCo introduces a task-preserving data filtering method that reduces data volume transmitted over the WAN. Finally, GeoCoCo develops a consistency-guaranteed transmission framework integrating grouping and pruning. Extensive evaluations in both trace-driven simulations and real-world deployments demonstrate that GeoCoCo reduces synchronization cost-primarily by lowering WAN bandwidth usage-by up to 40.3%, and increases system throughput by up to 14.1% in GeoGauss."}

With the rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs), recent studies have explored zero-shot and few-shot prompting to improve entity matching accuracy. However, most existing approaches rely on single-step prompting and offer limited investigation into structured reasoning strategies. In this work, we investigate how to enhance LLM-based entity matching by decomposing the matching process into multiple explicit reasoning stages. We propose a three-step framework that first identifies matched and unmatched tokens between two records, then determines the attributes most influential to the matching decision, and finally predicts whether the records refer to the same real-world entity. In addition, we explore a debate-based strategy that contrasts supporting and opposing arguments to improve decision robustness. We evaluate our approaches against multiple existing baselines on several real-world entity matching benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that structured multi-step reasoning can improve matching performance in several cases, while also highlighting remaining challenges and opportunities for further refinement of reasoning-guided LLM approaches."}

Serial Safety Net (SSN) offers a lightweight commit-time test but is conservative and effectively anchored on commit time as the sole point. We present ESSN, a principled generalization of SSN that relaxes the exclusion condition to allow more transactions to commit safely, and we prove that this preserves multiversion serializability (MVSR) and that it strictly subsumes SSN. ESSN states an MVSG (Multiversion Serialization Graph)-based criterion and introduces a known total order over transactions (KTO; e.g., begin-ordered or commit-ordered) for reasoning about the graph's serializability. With a single commit-time check under invariant-based semantics, ESSN's exclusion condition preserves monotonicity along per-item version chains, and eliminates chain traversal. The protocol is Direct Serialization Graph (DSG)-based with commit-time work linear in the number of reads and writes, matching SSN's per-version footprint. We also make mixed workloads explicit by defining a Long transaction via strict interval containment of Short transactions, and we evaluate ESSN on reproducible workloads. Under a commit-ordered KTO, using begin-snapshot reads reduces the long-transaction abort rate by up to approximately 0.25 absolute (about 50% relative) compared with SSN."}

In this work, we critically examine this assumption through a systematic analysis comparing neural CQA models with an alternative, training-free query relaxation strategy that retrieves possible answers by relaxing query constraints and counting resulting paths. Across multiple datasets and query structures, we find several cases where neural and relaxation-based approaches perform similarly, with no neural model consistently outperforming the latter. Moreover, a similarity analysis reveals that their retrieved answers exhibit little overlap, and that combining their outputs consistently improves performance. These results call for a re-evaluation of progress in neural query answering: despite their complexity, current models fail to subsume the reasoning patterns captured by query relaxation. Our findings highlight the importance of stronger non-neural baselines and suggest that future neural approaches could benefit from incorporating principles of query relaxation."}

However, the stateless nature of LLMs makes managing user context (e.g., sessions, preferences) across geo-distributed edge nodes challenging. Existing solutions, such as client-side context storage, often introduce network latency and bandwidth overhead, undermining the advantages of edge deployment.\n  We propose DisCEdge, a distributed context management system that stores and replicates user context in tokenized form across edge nodes. By maintaining context as token sequences rather than raw text, our system avoids redundant computation and enables efficient data replication. We implement and evaluate an open-source prototype in a realistic edge environment with commodity hardware. We show DisCEdge improves median response times by up to 14.46% and lowers median inter-node synchronization overhead by up to 15% compared to a raw-text-based system. It also reduces client request sizes by a median of 90% compared to client-side context management, while guaranteeing data consistency."}
