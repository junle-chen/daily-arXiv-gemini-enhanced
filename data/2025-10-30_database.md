Abstract: Running data analytics queries on serverless (FaaS) workers has been shown to be cost- and performance-efficient for a variety of real-world scenarios, including intermittent query arrival patterns, sudden load spikes and management challenges that afflict managed VM clusters. Alas, existing serverless data analytics works focus primarily on the serverless execution engine and assume the existence of a "good" query execution plan or rely on user guidance to construct such a plan. Meanwhile, even simple analytics queries on serverless have a huge space of possible plans, with vast differences in both performance and cost among plans.   This paper introduces Odyssey, an end-to-end serverless-native data analytics pipeline that integrates a query planner, cost model and execution engine. Odyssey automatically generates and evaluates serverless query plans, utilizing state space pruning heuristics and a novel search algorithm to identify Pareto-optimal plans that balance cost and performance with low latency even for complex queries. Our evaluations demonstrate that Odyssey accurately predicts both monetary cost and latency, and consistently outperforms AWS Athena on cost and/or latency.

Abstract: Joinable Column Discovery is a critical challenge in automating enterprise data analysis. While existing approaches focus on syntactic overlap and semantic similarity, there remains limited understanding of which methods perform best for different data characteristics and how multiple criteria influence discovery effectiveness. We present a comprehensive experimental evaluation of joinable column discovery methods across diverse scenarios. Our study compares syntactic and semantic techniques on seven benchmarks covering relational databases and data lakes. We analyze six key criteria -- unique values, intersection size, join size, reverse join size, value semantics, and metadata semantics -- and examine how combining them through ensemble ranking affects performance. Our analysis reveals differences in method behavior across data contexts and highlights the benefits of integrating multiple criteria for robust join discovery. We provide empirical evidence on when each criterion matters, compare pre-trained embedding models for semantic joins, and offer practical guidelines for selecting suitable methods based on dataset characteristics. Our findings show that metadata and value semantics are crucial for data lakes, size-based criteria play a stronger role in relational databases, and ensemble approaches consistently outperform single-criterion methods.
