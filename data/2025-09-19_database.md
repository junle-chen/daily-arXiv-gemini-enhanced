Abstract: The NIAID Data Ecosystem Discovery Portal (https://data.niaid.nih.gov) provides a unified search interface for over 4 million datasets relevant to infectious and immune-mediated disease (IID) research. Integrating metadata from domain-specific and generalist repositories, the Portal enables researchers to identify and access datasets using user-friendly filters or advanced queries, without requiring technical expertise. The Portal supports discovery of a wide range of resources, including epidemiological, clinical, and multi-omic datasets, and is designed to accommodate exploratory browsing and precise searches. The Portal provides filters, prebuilt queries, and dataset collections to simplify the discovery process for users. The Portal additionally provides documentation and an API for programmatic access to harmonized metadata. By easing access barriers to important biomedical datasets, the NIAID Data Ecosystem Discovery Portal serves as an entry point for researchers working to understand, diagnose, or treat IID.   Valuable datasets are often overlooked because they are difficult to locate. The NIAID Data Ecosystem Discovery Portal fills this gap by providing a centralized, searchable interface that empowers users with varying levels of technical expertise to find and reuse data. By standardizing key metadata fields and harmonizing heterogeneous formats, the Portal improves data findability, accessibility, and reusability. This resource supports hypothesis generation, comparative analysis, and secondary use of public data by the IID research community, including those funded by NIAID. The Portal supports data sharing by standardizing metadata and linking to source repositories, and maximizes the impact of public investment in research data by supporting scientific advancement via secondary use.

Abstract: In recent years, the Shapley value has emerged as a general game-theoretic measure for assessing the contribution of a tuple to the result of a database query. We study the complexity of calculating the Shapley value of a tuple for an aggregate conjunctive query, which applies an aggregation function to the result of a conjunctive query (CQ) based on a value function that assigns a number to each query answer. Prior work by Livshits, Bertossi, Kimelfeld, and Sebag (2020) established that this task is #P-hard for every nontrivial aggregation function when the query is non-hierarchical with respect to its existential variables, assuming the absence of self-joins. They further showed that this condition precisely characterizes the class of intractable CQs when the aggregate function is sum or count. In addition, they posed as open problems the complexity of other common aggregate functions such as min, max, count-distinct, average, and quantile (including median). Towards the resolution of these problems, we identify for each aggregate function a class of hierarchical CQs where the Shapley value is tractable with every value function, as long as it is local (i.e., determined by the tuples of one relation). We further show that each such class is maximal: for every CQ outside of this class, there is a local (easy-to-compute) value function that makes the Shapley value #P-hard. Interestingly, our results reveal that each aggregate function corresponds to a different generalization of the class of hierarchical CQs from Boolean to non-Boolean queries. In particular, max, min, and count-distinct match the class of CQs that are all-hierarchical (i.e., hierarchical with respect to all variables), and average and quantile match the narrower class of q-hierarchical CQs introduced by Berkholz, Keppeler, and Schweikardt (2017) in the context of the fine-grained complexity of query answering.

Abstract: The increasing volume and complexity of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) data generated at synchrotron facilities worldwide require robust infrastructure for data management, sharing, and analysis. This paper introduces the XAS Database (XASDB), a comprehensive web-based platform developed and hosted by the Canadian Light Source (CLS). The database houses more than 1000 reference spectra spanning 40 elements and 324 chemical compounds. The platform employs a Node.js/MongoDB architecture designed to handle diverse data formats from multiple beamlines and synchrotron facilities. A key innovation is the XASproc JavaScript library, which enables browser-based XAS data processing including normalization, background sub- traction, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) extraction, and preliminary analysis traditionally limited to desktop applications. The integrated XASVue spectral viewer provides installation-free data visualization and analysis with broad accessibility across devices and operating systems. By offering standardized data output, comprehensive metadata, and integrated analytical ca- pabilities, XASDB facilitates collaborative research and promotes FAIR (Findable, Accessible, In- teroperable, and Reusable) data principles. The platform serves as a valuable resource for linear combination fitting (LCF) analysis, machine learning applications, and educational purposes. This initiative demonstrates the potential for web-centric approaches in XAS data analysis, accelerating advances in materials science, environmental research, chemistry, and biology.

Abstract: Most research on query optimization has centered on binary join algorithms like hash join and sort-merge join. However, recent years have seen growing interest in theoretically optimal algorithms, notably Yannakakis' algorithm. These algorithms rely on join trees, which differ from the operator trees for binary joins and require new optimization techniques. We propose three approaches to constructing join trees for acyclic queries. First, we give an algorithm to enumerate all join trees of an alpha-acyclic query by edits with amortized constant delay, which forms the basis of a cost-based optimizer for acyclic joins. Second, we show that the Maximum Cardinality Search algorithm by Tarjan and Yannakakis constructs a unique shallowest join tree, rooted at any relation, for a Berge-acyclic query; this tree enables parallel execution of large join queries. Finally, we prove that any connected left-deep linear plan for a gamma-acyclic query can be converted into a join tree by a simple algorithm, allowing reuse of optimization infrastructure developed for binary joins.

Abstract: Modern scientific discovery increasingly relies on workflows that process data across the Edge, Cloud, and High Performance Computing (HPC) continuum. Comprehensive and in-depth analyses of these data are critical for hypothesis validation, anomaly detection, reproducibility, and impactful findings. Although workflow provenance techniques support such analyses, at large scale, the provenance data become complex and difficult to analyze. Existing systems depend on custom scripts, structured queries, or static dashboards, limiting data interaction. In this work, we introduce an evaluation methodology, reference architecture, and open-source implementation that leverages interactive Large Language Model (LLM) agents for runtime data analysis. Our approach uses a lightweight, metadata-driven design that translates natural language into structured provenance queries. Evaluations across LLaMA, GPT, Gemini, and Claude, covering diverse query classes and a real-world chemistry workflow, show that modular design, prompt tuning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enable accurate and insightful LLM agent responses beyond recorded provenance.
