With the growing demand for predictive analytics, the deep integration of machine learning (ML) into RDBMS has become critical. However, a fundamental challenge hinders this evolution: conventional ML models are static and task-specific, whereas RDBMS environments are dynamic and must support diverse analytical queries. Each analytical task entails constructing a bespoke pipeline from scratch, which incurs significant development overhead and hence limits wide adoption of ML in analytics.\n  We present NeurIDA, an autonomous end-to-end system for in-database analytics that dynamically \"tweaks\" the best available base model to better serve a given analytical task. In particular, we propose a novel paradigm of dynamic in-database modeling to pre-train a composable base model architecture over the relational data. Upon receiving a task, NeurIDA formulates the task and data profile to dynamically select and configure relevant components from the pool of base models and shared model components for prediction. For friendly user experience, NeurIDA supports natural language queries; it interprets user intent to construct structured task profiles, and generates analytical reports with dedicated LLM agents. By design, NeurIDA enables ease-of-use and yet effective and efficient in-database AI analytics. Extensive experiment study shows that NeurIDA consistently delivers up to 12% improvement in AUC-ROC and 25% relative reduction in MAE across ten tasks on five real-world datasets.

We address the problem of quantifying how far a dataset deviates from such trends. To this end, we introduce Aggregate Order Dependencies (AODs), an aggregation-centric extension of the previously studied order dependencies. An AOD specifies that the aggregated value of a target attribute (e.g., mean salary) should monotonically increase or decrease with the grouping attribute (e.g., education level).\n  We formulate the AOD repair problem as finding the smallest set of tuples to delete from a table so that the given AOD is satisfied. We analyze the computational complexity of this problem and propose a general algorithmic template for solving it. We instantiate the template for common aggregation functions, introduce optimization techniques that substantially improve the runtime of the template instances, and develop efficient heuristic alternatives. Our experimental study, carried out on both real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrates the practical efficiency of the algorithms and provides insight into the performance of the heuristics. We also present case studies that uncover and explain unexpected AOD violations using our framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}

To better understand an observed disparity, we need explanations that can pinpoint the data regions where the disparity is most pronounced, along with its causes, i.e., factors that alleviate or exacerbate the disparity. This task is complex and tedious, particularly for large and high-dimensional datasets, demanding an automatic system for discovering explanations (data regions and causes) of an observed disparity. It is critical that explanations for disparities are not only interpretable but also actionable-enabling users to make informed, data-driven decisions. This requires explanations to go beyond surface-level correlations and instead capture causal relationships. We introduce ExDis, a framework for discovering causal Explanations for Disparities between two groups of interest. ExDis identifies data regions (subpopulations) where disparities are most pronounced (or reversed), and associates specific factors that causally contribute to the disparity within each identified data region. We formally define the ExDis framework and the associated optimization problem, analyze its complexity, and develop an efficient algorithm to solve the problem. Through extensive experiments over three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that ExDis generates meaningful causal explanations, outperforms prior methods, and scales effectively to handle large, high-dimensional datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}

Both approaches enforce structural and behavioral correctness through graph-theoretic modeling, bridging formal methods and real-world practice. PBFD and PDFD model software development as layered directed graphs with unified state machines, verified using Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) and Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). This guarantees bounded-refinement termination, deadlock freedom, and structural completeness. To manage hierarchical data at scale, we present the Three-Level Encapsulation (TLE)-a novel bitmask-based encoding scheme. TLE operations are verified via CSP failures-divergences refinement, ensuring constant-time updates and compact storage that underpin PBFD's robust performance. PBFD demonstrates exceptional industrial viability through eight years of enterprise deployment with zero critical failures, achieving approximately 20x faster develop-ment than Salesforce OmniScript, 7-8x faster query performance, and 11.7x storage reduction compared to conventional relational models. These results are established through longitudinal observational studies, quasi-experimental runtime comparisons, and controlled schema-level experiments.

It spans data architecture and systems, integration, quality, governance, and continuous improvement. While AI assistants can help specific persona, such as data engineers and stewards, to navigate and configure the data stack, they fall far short of full automation. However, as AI becomes increasingly capable of tackling tasks that have previously resisted automation due to inherent complexities, we believe there is an imminent opportunity to target fully autonomous data estates. Currently, AI is used in different parts of the data stack, but in this paper, we argue for a paradigm shift from the use of AI in independent data component operations towards a more holistic and autonomous handling of the entire data lifecycle. Towards that end, we explore how each stage of the modern data stack can be autonomously managed by intelligent agents to build self-sufficient systems that can be used not only by human end-users, but also by AI itself. We begin by describing the mounting forces and opportunities that demand this paradigm shift, examine how agents can streamline the data lifecycle, and highlight open questions and areas where additional research is needed.

A common approach to leverage this data is to train a graph neural network (GNN) on the KG. However, existing message-passing GNNs struggle to scale to large KGs because they rely on the iterative message passing process to learn the graph structure, which is inefficient, especially under mini-batch training, where a node sees only a partial view of its neighborhood. In this paper, we address this problem and present gHAWK, a novel and scalable GNN training framework for large KGs. The key idea is to precompute structural features for each node that capture its local and global structure before GNN training even begins. Specifically, gHAWK introduces a preprocessing step that computes: (a)~Bloom filters to compactly encode local neighborhood structure, and (b)~TransE embeddings to represent each node's global position in the graph. These features are then fused with any domain-specific features (e.g., text embeddings), producing a node feature vector that can be incorporated into any GNN technique. By augmenting message-passing training with structural priors, gHAWK significantly reduces memory usage, accelerates convergence, and improves model accuracy. Extensive experiments on large datasets from the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) demonstrate that gHAWK achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and lower training time on both node property prediction and link prediction tasks, topping the OGB leaderboard for three graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}
