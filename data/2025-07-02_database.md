Abstract: Semantic caching significantly reduces computational costs and improves efficiency by storing and reusing large language model (LLM) responses. However, existing systems rely primarily on matching individual queries, lacking awareness of multi-turn dialogue contexts, which leads to incorrect cache hits when similar queries appear in different conversational settings. This demonstration introduces ContextCache, a context-aware semantic caching system for multi-turn dialogues. ContextCache employs a two-stage retrieval architecture that first executes vector-based retrieval on the current query to identify potential matches and then integrates current and historical dialogue representations through self-attention mechanisms for precise contextual matching. Evaluation of real-world conversations shows that ContextCache improves precision and recall compared to existing methods. Additionally, cached responses exhibit approximately 10 times lower latency than direct LLM invocation, enabling significant computational cost reductions for LLM conversational applications.

Abstract: Modern enterprise database systems face significant challenges in balancing data security and performance. Ensuring robust encryption for sensitive information is critical for systems' compliance with security standards. Although holistic database encryption provides strong protection, existing database systems often require a complete backup and restore cycle, resulting in prolonged downtime and increased storage usage. This makes it difficult to implement online encryption techniques in high-throughput environments without disrupting critical operations.   To address this challenge, we envision a solution that enables online database encryption aligned with system activity, eliminating the need for downtime, storage overhead, or full-database reprocessing. Central to this vision is the ability to predict which parts of the database will be accessed next, allowing encryption to be applied online. As a step towards this solution, this study proposes a predictive approach that leverages deep learning models to forecast database lock sequences, using IBM Db2 as the database system under study. In this study, we collected a specialized dataset from TPC-C benchmark workloads, leveraging lock event logs for model training and evaluation. We applied deep learning architectures, such as Transformer and LSTM, to evaluate models for various table-level and page-level lock predictions. We benchmark the accuracy of the trained models versus a Naive Baseline across different prediction horizons and timelines.   The study experiments demonstrate that the proposed deep learning-based models achieve up to 49% average accuracy for table-level and 66% for page-level predictions, outperforming a Naive Baseline. By anticipating which tables and pages will be locked next, the proposed approach is a step toward online encryption, offering a practical path toward secure, low-overhead database systems.

Abstract: In the financial industry, data is the lifeblood of operations, and DBAs shoulder significant responsibilities for SQL tuning, database deployment, diagnosis, and service repair. In recent years, both database vendors and customers have increasingly turned to autonomous database platforms in an effort to alleviate the heavy workload of DBAs. However, existing autonomous database platforms are limited in their capabilities, primarily addressing single-point issues such as NL2SQL, anomaly detection, and SQL tuning. Manual intervention remains a necessity for comprehensive database maintenance. GaussMaster aims to revolutionize this landscape by introducing an LLM-based database copilot system. This innovative solution is designed not only to assist developers in writing efficient SQL queries but also to provide comprehensive care for database services. When database instances exhibit abnormal behavior, GaussMaster is capable of orchestrating the entire maintenance process automatically. It achieves this by analyzing hundreds of metrics and logs, employing a Tree-of-thought approach to identify root causes, and invoking appropriate tools to resolve issues. We have successfully implemented GaussMaster in real-world scenarios, such as the banking industry, where it has achieved zero human intervention for over 34 database maintenance scenarios. In this paper, we present significant improvements in these tasks with code at https://gitcode.com/opengauss/openGauss-GaussMaster.

Abstract: There is an increasing demand for extending existing DBMSs with vector indices so that they become unified systems capable of supporting modern predictive applications, which require joint querying of vector embeddings together with the structured properties and connections of objects. We present NaviX, a native vector index for graph DBMSs (GDBMSs) that has two main design goals. First, we aim to implement a disk-based vector index that leverages the core storage and query-processing capabilities of the underlying GDBMS. To this end, NaviX is built on the Hierarchical Navigable Small-World (HNSW) graph, which itself is a graph-based structure. Second, we aim to support predicate-agnostic filtered vector search queries, in which the k nearest neighbors (kNNs) of a query vector vQ are searched only within an arbitrary subset S of vectors defined by an ad-hoc selection sub-query QS. We adopt a prefiltering approach that evaluates QS first and passes the full description of subset S to the kNN search operator. We study how to design a prefiltering search algorithm that remains robust under varying selectivities and under different correlations between subset S and query vector vQ. We propose an adaptive algorithm that uses the local selectivity of each vector in the HNSW graph to choose an appropriate heuristic at every iteration of the kNN search. Finally, We demonstrate NaviX's robustness and efficiency through extensive experiments against both existing prefiltering- and postfiltering-based baselines.

Abstract: Relational Deep Learning (RDL) is an emerging paradigm that leverages Graph Neural Network principles to learn directly from relational databases by representing them as heterogeneous graphs. However, existing RDL models typically rely on task-specific supervised learning, requiring training separate models for each predictive task, which may hamper scalability and reuse.   In this work, we propose a novel task-agnostic contrastive pretraining approach for RDL that enables database-wide representation learning. For that aim, we introduce three levels of contrastive objectives$-$row-level, link-level, and context-level$-$designed to capture the structural and semantic heterogeneity inherent to relational data. We implement the respective pretraining approach through a modular RDL architecture and an efficient sampling strategy tailored to the heterogeneous database setting. Our preliminary results on standard RDL benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning the pretrained models measurably outperforms training from scratch, validating the promise of the proposed methodology in learning transferable representations for relational data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools but are often expensive to deploy at scale. LLM query routing mitigates this by dynamically assigning queries to models of varying cost and quality to obtain a desired trade-off. Prior query routing approaches generate only one response from the selected model and a single response from a small (inexpensive) model was often not good enough to beat a response from a large (expensive) model due to which they end up overusing the large model and missing out on potential cost savings. However, it is well known that for small models, generating multiple responses and selecting the best can enhance quality while remaining cheaper than a single large-model response. We leverage this idea to propose BEST-Route, a novel routing framework that chooses a model and the number of responses to sample from it based on query difficulty and the quality thresholds. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method reduces costs by up to 60% with less than 1% performance drop.
