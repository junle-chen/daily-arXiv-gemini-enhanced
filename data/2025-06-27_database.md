Abstract: Robust Document Layout Analysis (DLA) is critical for the automated processing and understanding of historical documents with complex page organizations. This paper benchmarks five state-of-the-art object detection architectures on three annotated datasets representing a spectrum of codicological complexity: The e-NDP, a corpus of Parisian medieval registers (1326-1504); CATMuS, a diverse multiclass dataset derived from various medieval and modern sources (ca.12th-17th centuries) and HORAE, a corpus of decorated books of hours (ca.13th-16th centuries). We evaluate two Transformer-based models (Co-DETR, Grounding DINO) against three YOLO variants (AABB, OBB, and YOLO-World). Our findings reveal significant performance variations dependent on model architecture, data set characteristics, and bounding box representation. In the e-NDP dataset, Co-DETR achieves state-of-the-art results (0.752 mAP@.50:.95), closely followed by YOLOv11X-OBB (0.721). Conversely, on the more complex CATMuS and HORAE datasets, the CNN-based YOLOv11x-OBB significantly outperforms all other models (0.564 and 0.568, respectively). This study unequivocally demonstrates that using Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB) is not a minor refinement but a fundamental requirement for accurately modeling the non-Cartesian nature of historical manuscripts. We conclude that a key trade-off exists between the global context awareness of Transformers, ideal for structured layouts, and the superior generalization of CNN-OBB models for visually diverse and complex documents.

Abstract: Huawei's cloud-native database system GaussDB for MySQL (also known as Taurus) stores data in a separate storage layer consisting of a pool of storage servers. Each server has considerable compute power making it possible to push data reduction operations (selection, projection, and aggregation) close to storage. This paper describes the design and implementation of near data processing (NDP) in Taurus. NDP has several benefits: it reduces the amount of data shipped over the network; frees up CPU capacity in the compute layer; and reduces query run time, thereby enabling higher system throughput. Experiments with the TPCH benchmark (100 GB) showed that 18 out of 22 queries benefited from NDP; data shipped was reduced by 63 percent; and CPU time by 50 percent. On Q15 the impact was even higher: data shipped was reduced by 98 percent; CPU time by 91 percent; and run time by 80 percent.

Abstract: A growing trend in the database and system communities is to augment conventional index structures, such as B+-trees, with machine learning (ML) models. Among these, error-bounded Piecewise Linear Approximation ($\epsilon$-PLA) has emerged as a popular choice due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Despite its central role in many learned indexes, the design and analysis of $\epsilon$-PLA fitting algorithms remain underexplored. In this paper, we revisit $\epsilon$-PLA from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, with a focus on its application in learned index structures. We first establish a fundamentally improved lower bound of $\Omega(\kappa \cdot \epsilon^2)$ on the expected segment coverage for existing $\epsilon$-PLA fitting algorithms, where $\kappa$ is a data-dependent constant. We then present a comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art $\epsilon$-PLA algorithms when used in different learned data structures. Our results highlight key trade-offs among model accuracy, model size, and query performance, providing actionable guidelines for the principled design of future learned data structures.

Abstract: Time series imputation models have traditionally been developed using complete datasets with artificial masking patterns to simulate missing values. However, in real-world infrastructure monitoring, practitioners often encounter datasets where large amounts of data are missing and follow complex, heterogeneous patterns. We introduce DIM-SUM, a preprocessing framework for training robust imputation models that bridges the gap between artificially masked training data and real missing patterns. DIM-SUM combines pattern clustering and adaptive masking strategies with theoretical learning guarantees to handle diverse missing patterns actually observed in the data. Through extensive experiments on over 2 billion readings from California water districts, electricity datasets, and benchmarks, we demonstrate that DIM-SUM outperforms traditional methods by reaching similar accuracy with lower processing time and significantly less training data. When compared against a large pre-trained model, DIM-SUM averages 2x higher accuracy with significantly less inference time.
