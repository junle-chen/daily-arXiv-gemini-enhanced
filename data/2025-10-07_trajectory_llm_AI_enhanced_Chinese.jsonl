In this work, we introduce Markovian Reeb\nGraphs, a novel framework for simulating spatiotemporal trajectories that\npreserve Patterns of Life (PoLs) learned from baseline data. By combining\nindividual- and population-level mobility structures within a probabilistic\ntopological model, our approach generates realistic future trajectories that\ncapture both consistency and variability in daily life. Evaluations on the\nUrban Anomalies dataset (Atlanta and Berlin subsets) using the Jensen-Shannon\nDivergence (JSD) across population- and agent-level metrics demonstrate that\nthe proposed method achieves strong fidelity while remaining data- and\ncompute-efficient. These results position Markovian Reeb Graphs as a scalable\nframework for trajectory simulation with broad applicability across diverse\nurban environments.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8f68\u8ff9\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592bReeb\u56fe\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c5e\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u5230\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u79fb\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u53ef\u80fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u6216\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u3002", "keywords": ["trajectory simulation", "spatiotemporal trajectories", "Patterns of Life", "mobility", "Markovian Reeb Graphs"]}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}
