Abstract: Electronic payment platforms are estimated to process billions oftransactions daily, with the cumulative value of these transactionspotentially reaching into the trillions. Even a minor error within thishigh-volume environment could precipitate substantial financiallosses. To mitigate this risk, manually constructed verification rules,developed by domain experts, are typically employed to identifyand scrutinize transactions in production environments. However,due to the absence of a systematic approach to ensure the robust-ness of these verification rules against vulnerabilities, they remainsusceptible to exploitation.To mitigate this risk, manually constructed verification rules, de-veloped by domain experts, are typically employed to identify andscrutinize transactions in production environments. However, dueto the absence of a systematic approach to ensure the robustness ofthese verification rules against vulnerabilities, they remain suscep-tible to exploitation. To ensure data security, database maintainersusually compose complex verification rules to check whether aquery/update request is valid. However, the rules written by ex-perts are usually imperfect, and malicious requests may bypassthese rules. As a result, the demand for identifying the defects ofthe rules systematically emerges.

Abstract: The lack of standardized tabular formats for tenancy schedules across real estate firms creates significant inefficiencies in data integration. Existing automated integration methods, such as Full Disjunction (FD)-based models like ALITE, prioritize completeness but result in schema bloat, sparse attributes and limited business usability. We propose a novel hybrid, template-based schema matcher that aligns multi-layout tenancy schedules to a predefined target schema. The matcher combines schema (Jaccard, Levenshtein) and instance-based metrics (data types, distributions) with globally optimal assignments determined via the Hungarian Algorithm. Evaluation against a manually labeled ground truth demonstrates substantial improvements, with grid search optimization yielding a peak F1-score of 0.881 and an overall null percentage of 45.7%. On a separate ground truth of 20 semantically similar column sets, ALITE achieves an F1-score of 0.712 and 75.6% nulls. These results suggest that combining structured business knowledge with hybrid matching can yield more usable and business-aligned schema mappings. The approach assumes cleanly extracted tabular input, future work could explore extending the matcher to support complex, composite tables.
