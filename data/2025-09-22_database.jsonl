We\npresent the Spezi Data Pipeline, an open-source Python toolkit designed to\nstreamline the analysis of digital health data, from secure access and\nretrieval to processing, visualization, and export. The Pipeline is integrated\ninto the larger Stanford Spezi open-source ecosystem for developing research\nand translational digital health software systems. Leveraging HL7 FHIR-based\ndata representations, the pipeline enables standardized handling of diverse\ndata types--including sensor-derived observations, ECG recordings, and clinical\nquestionnaires--across research and clinical environments. We detail the\nmodular system architecture and demonstrate its application using real-world\ndata from the PAWS at Stanford University, in which the pipeline facilitated\nefficient extraction, transformation, and clinician-driven review of Apple\nWatch ECG data, supporting annotation and comparative analysis alongside\ntraditional monitors. By reducing the need for bespoke development and\nenhancing workflow efficiency, the Spezi Data Pipeline advances the scalability\nand interoperability of digital health research, ultimately supporting improved\ncare delivery and patient outcomes."}

Yet, creating a repository that adheres to these\nprinciples presents significant challenges. Managing large volumes of diverse\nresearch data and metadata, often generated rapidly, requires a precise\napproach. This necessity has led to the development of Software Reference\nArchitectures (SRAs) to guide the implementation process for FAIR-compliant\nrepositories. This article conducts a systematic review of research efforts\nfocused on architectural solutions for such repositories. We detail our\nmethodology, covering all activities undertaken in the planning and execution\nphases of the review. We analyze 323 references from reputable sources and\nexpert recommendations, identifying 7 studies on general-purpose big data SRAs,\n13 pipelines implementing FAIR Principles in specific contexts, and 3\nFAIR-compliant big data SRAs. We provide a thorough description of their key\nfeatures and assess whether the research questions posed in the planning phase\nwere adequately addressed. Additionally, we discuss the limitations of the\nretrieved studies and identify tendencies and opportunities for further\nresearch."}

We\nargue for a new paradigm, which we call computing on unstructured data, built\naround three stages: extraction of latent structure, transformation of this\nstructure through data processing techniques, and projection back into\nunstructured formats. This bi-directional pipeline allows unstructured data to\nbenefit from the analytical power of structured computation, while preserving\nthe richness and accessibility of unstructured representations for human and AI\nconsumption. We illustrate this paradigm through two use cases and present the\nresearch components that need to be developed in a new data system called\nMXFlow."}

This design makes it difficult for users to\nfind datasets using natural language queries. The problem is worsened by\nmetadata that is often incomplete or inconsistent, especially when users lack\nfamiliarity with domain-specific terminology. In this paper, we examine how\nindividual metadata fields affect the success of conversational dataset\nretrieval and whether LLMs can help bridge the gap between natural queries and\nstructured metadata. We conduct a controlled ablation study using simulated\nnatural language queries over real-world datasets to evaluate retrieval\nperformance under various metadata configurations. We also compare existing\ncontent of the metadata field 'description' with LLM-generated content,\nexploring how different prompting strategies influence quality and impact on\nsearch outcomes. Our findings suggest that dataset descriptions play a central\nrole in aligning with user intent, and that LLM-generated descriptions can\nsupport effective retrieval. These results highlight both the limitations of\ncurrent metadata practices and the potential of generative models to improve\ndataset discoverability in open data portals."}

While most prior work assumes a known causal\nmodel, recent efforts relax this assumption by enforcing additional\nconstraints. However, these approaches often fail to capture broader attribute\nrelationships that are critical to maintaining utility. This raises a\nfundamental question: Can we harness the benefits of causal reasoning to design\nefficient and effective fairness solutions without relying on strong\nassumptions about the underlying causal model? In this paper, we seek to answer\nthis question by introducing CausalPre, a scalable and effective\ncausality-guided data pre-processing framework that guarantees justifiable\nfairness, a strong causal notion of fairness. CausalPre extracts causally fair\nrelationships by reformulating the originally complex and computationally\ninfeasible extraction task into a tailored distribution estimation problem. To\nensure scalability, CausalPre adopts a carefully crafted variant of\nlow-dimensional marginal factorization to approximate the joint distribution,\ncomplemented by a heuristic algorithm that efficiently tackles the associated\ncomputational challenge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that CausalPre is both effective and scalable, challenging the\nconventional belief that achieving causal fairness requires trading off\nrelationship coverage for relaxed model assumptions."}
