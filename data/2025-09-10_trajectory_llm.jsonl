Such knowledge and experiences can guide the model\nin uncovering latent patterns within traffic data, thereby enhancing the\naccuracy and robustness of predictions. To this end, this paper proposes\nintegrating structured temporal traffic data with textual data representing\nhuman knowledge and experience, resulting in a novel knowledge-guided\ncross-modal feature representation learning (KGCM) model for traffic demand\nprediction.
