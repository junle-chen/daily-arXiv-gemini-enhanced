Abstract: We introduce Memory-QA, a novel real-world task that involves answering recall questions about visual content from previously stored multimodal memories. This task poses unique challenges, including the creation of task-oriented memories, the effective utilization of temporal and location information within memories, and the ability to draw upon multiple memories to answer a recall question. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive pipeline, Pensieve, integrating memory-specific augmentation, time- and location-aware multi-signal retrieval, and multi-memory QA fine-tuning. We created a multimodal benchmark to illustrate various real challenges in this task, and show the superior performance of Pensieve over state-of-the-art solutions (up to 14% on QA accuracy).

Abstract: Graph analytics is widely used in many fields to analyze various complex patterns. However, in most cases, important data in companies is stored in RDBMS's, and so, it is necessary to extract graphs from relational databases to perform graph analysis. Most of the existing methods do not extract a user-intended graph since it typically requires complex join query processing. We propose an efficient graph extraction method, \textit{ExtGraph}, which can extract user-intended graphs efficiently by hybrid query processing of outer join and materialized view. Through experiments using the TPC-DS, DBLP, and IMDB datasets, we have shown that \textit{ExtGraph} outperforms the state-of-the-art methods up to by 2.78x in terms of graph extraction time.

Abstract: Embedding models capture both semantic and syntactic structures of queries, often mapping different queries to similar regions in vector space. This results in non-uniform cluster access patterns in modern disk-based vector databases. While existing approaches optimize individual queries, they overlook the impact of cluster access patterns, failing to account for the locality effects of queries that access similar clusters. This oversight increases cache miss penalty. To minimize the cache miss penalty, we propose CALL, a context-aware query grouping mechanism that organizes queries based on shared cluster access patterns. Additionally, CALL incorporates a group-aware prefetching method to minimize cache misses during transitions between query groups and latency-aware cluster loading. Experimental results show that CALL reduces the 99th percentile tail latency by up to 33% while consistently maintaining a higher cache hit ratio, substantially reducing search latency.

Abstract: Research data management (RDM) is a key data literacy skill that chemistry students must acquire. Concepts such as the FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) should be taught and applied in undergraduate studies already. Traditionally, research data from labs, theses, and internships were handwritten and stored in inaccessible formats such as PDFs, limiting reuse and machine learning applications. At RWTH Aachen University, a fifth-semester lab course introduces students to the electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) Chemotion, an open-source DFG-funded tool linked to the national NFDI4Chem initiative. Students plan, document, and evaluate experiments digitally, ensuring metadata and analysis are captured for long-term reuse. Chemotion's intuitive interface and repository enable sustainable data sharing. To reinforce RDM, students receive a seminar and access to online training videos with interactive Moodle elements. Herein we highlight the use of the DALIA platform as a discovery tool for the students.

Abstract: Continuous and reliable access to curated biological data repositories is indispensable for accelerating rigorous scientific inquiry and fostering reproducible research. Centralized repositories, though widely used, are vulnerable to single points of failure arising from cyberattacks, technical faults, natural disasters, or funding and political uncertainties. This can lead to widespread data unavailability, data loss, integrity compromises, and substantial delays in critical research, ultimately impeding scientific progress. Centralizing essential scientific resources in a single geopolitical or institutional hub is inherently dangerous, as any disruption can paralyze diverse ongoing research. The rapid acceleration of data generation, combined with an increasingly volatile global landscape, necessitates a critical re-evaluation of the sustainability of centralized models. Implementing federated and decentralized architectures presents a compelling and future-oriented pathway to substantially strengthen the resilience of scientific data infrastructures, thereby mitigating vulnerabilities and ensuring the long-term integrity of data. Here, we examine the structural limitations of centralized repositories, evaluate federated and decentralized models, and propose a hybrid framework for resilient, FAIR, and sustainable scientific data stewardship. Such an approach offers a significant reduction in exposure to governance instability, infrastructural fragility, and funding volatility, and also fosters fairness and global accessibility. The future of open science depends on integrating these complementary approaches to establish a globally distributed, economically sustainable, and institutionally robust infrastructure that safeguards scientific data as a public good, further ensuring continued accessibility, interoperability, and preservation for generations to come.

Abstract: The $ k $-plex model, which allows each vertex to miss connections with up to $ k $ neighbors, serves as a relaxation of the clique. Its adaptability makes it more suitable for analyzing real-world graphs where noise and imperfect data are common and the ideal clique model is often impractical. The problem of identifying the maximum $ k $-plex (MKP, which is NP-hard) is gaining attention in fields such as social network analysis, community detection, terrorist network identification, and graph clustering. Recent works have focused on optimizing the time complexity of MKP algorithms. The state-of-the-art has reduced the complexity from a trivial $ O^*(2^n) $ to $ O^*(c_k^n) $, with $ c_k > 1.94 $ for $ k \geq 3 $, where $ n $ denotes the vertex number. This paper investigates the MKP using two quantum models: gate-based model and annealing-based model. Two gate-based algorithms, qTKP and qMKP, are proposed to achieve $ O^*(1.42^n) $ time complexity. qTKP integrates quantum search with graph encoding, degree counting, degree comparison, and size determination to find a $ k $-plex of a given size; qMKP uses binary search to progressively identify the maximum solution. Furthermore, by reformulating MKP as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem, we propose qaMKP, the first annealing-based approximation algorithm, which utilizes qubit resources more efficiently than gate-based algorithms. To validate the practical performance, proof-of-principle experiments were conducted using the latest IBM gate-based quantum simulator and D-Wave adiabatic quantum computer. This work holds potential to be applied to a wide range of clique relaxations, e.g., $ n $-clan and $ n $-club.
