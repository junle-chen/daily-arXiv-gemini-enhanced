However, existing methods struggle to\ncomprehensively address the autonomy-oriented requirements of balancing: (i)\ndynamical fidelity, (ii) photorealistic rendering, (iii) context-relevant\nscenario orchestration, and (iv) real-time performance. To address these\nlimitations, we present a unified framework for creating and curating\nhigh-fidelity digital twins to accelerate advancements in autonomous driving\nresearch. Our framework leverages a mix of physics-based and data-driven\ntechniques for developing and simulating digital twins of autonomous vehicles\nand their operating environments. It is capable of reconstructing real-world\nscenes and assets (real2sim) with geometric and photorealistic accuracy and\ninfusing them with various physical properties to enable real-time dynamical\nsimulation of the ensuing driving scenarios. Additionally, it also incorporates\na large language model (LLM) interface to flexibly edit the driving scenarios\nonline via natural language prompts. We analyze the presented framework in\nterms of its fidelity, performance, and serviceability. Results indicate that\nour framework can reconstruct 3D scenes and assets with up to 97% structural\nsimilarity, while maintaining frame rates above 60 Hz.

To\nvalidate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments in both simulated\nenvironments and on real robotic platforms.

A critical research challenge arises: constructing\nan informative driving world model to enable perception annotation-free,\nend-to-end planning via self-supervised learning. In this paper, we present\nWorld4Drive, an end-to-end autonomous driving framework that employs vision\nfoundation models to build latent world models for generating and evaluating\nmulti-modal planning trajectories. Specifically, World4Drive first extracts\nscene features, including driving intention and world latent representations\nenriched with spatial-semantic priors provided by vision foundation models. It\nthen generates multi-modal planning trajectories based on current scene\nfeatures and driving intentions and predicts multiple intention-driven future\nstates within the latent space. Finally, it introduces a world model selector\nmodule to evaluate and select the best trajectory. We achieve perception\nannotation-free, end-to-end planning through self-supervised alignment between\nactual future observations and predicted observations reconstructed from the\nlatent space.

Given a language\ncommand and an initial scene image, a video diffusion model generates potential\ndemonstration videos, and a vision-language model (VLM) automatically filters\nout results that do not follow the command. A 6D pose tracker then extracts\nobject trajectories from the video, and the trajectories are retargeted to the\nrobot in an embodiment-agnostic fashion. Through extensive real-world\nevaluations, we show that filtered generated videos are as effective as real\ndemonstrations, and that performance improves with generation quality. We also\nshow that relying on generated videos outperforms more compact alternatives\nsuch as keypoint prediction using VLMs, and that strong 6D pose tracking\noutperforms other ways to extract trajectories, such as dense feature point\ntracking. These findings suggest that videos produced by a state-of-the-art\noff-the-shelf model can offer an effective source of supervision for robotic\nmanipulation.", "relevance_analysis":

However, accurately\nforecasting iceberg trajectories remains a formidable challenge, primarily due\nto the scarcity of spatiotemporal data and the complex, nonlinear nature of\niceberg motion, which is also impacted by environmental variables. The iceberg\nmotion is influenced by multiple dynamic environmental factors, creating a\nhighly variable system that makes trajectory identification complex. These\nlimitations hinder the ability of deep learning models to effectively capture\nthe underlying dynamics and provide reliable predictive outcomes. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a hybrid IDRIFTNET model, a physics-driven deep\nlearning model that combines an analytical formulation of iceberg drift\nphysics, with an augmented residual learning model.

We introduce Box-QAymo, a\nbox-referring dataset and benchmark designed to both evaluate and finetune VLMs\non spatial and temporal reasoning over user-specified objects. Users express\nintent by drawing bounding boxes, offering a fast and intuitive interface for\nfocused queries in complex scenes. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical\nevaluation protocol that begins with binary sanity-check questions to assess\nbasic model capacities, and progresses to (1) attribute prediction for\nbox-referred objects, (2) motion understanding of target instances, and (3)\nspatiotemporal motion reasoning over inter-object dynamics across frames. To\nsupport this, we crowd-sourced fine-grained object classes and visual\nattributes that reflect the complexity drivers encounter, and extract object\ntrajectories to construct temporally grounded QA pairs. Rigorous quality\ncontrol through negative sampling, temporal consistency checks, and\ndifficulty-aware balancing guarantee dataset robustness and diversity. Our\ncomprehensive evaluation reveals significant limitations in current VLMs when\nqueried about perception questions, highlighting the gap in achieving\nreal-world performance. This work provides a foundation for developing more\nrobust and interpretable autonomous driving systems that can communicate\neffectively with users under real-world conditions.

Accurate prediction of such manoeuvres is\nessential for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) to make timely and\ninformed decisions. In this study, we focus on overtake detection using\nController Area Network (CAN) bus data collected from five in-service trucks\nprovided by the Volvo Group. We evaluate three common classifiers for vehicle\nmanoeuvre detection, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and\nSupport Vector Machines (SVM), and analyse how different preprocessing\nconfigurations affect performance. We find that variability in traffic\nconditions strongly influences the signal patterns, particularly in the\nno-overtake class, affecting classification performance if training data lacks\nadequate diversity. Since the data were collected under unconstrained,\nreal-world conditions, class diversity cannot be guaranteed a priori. However,\ntraining with data from multiple vehicles improves generalisation and reduces\ncondition-specific bias. Our pertruck analysis also reveals that classification\naccuracy, especially for overtakes, depends on the amount of training data per\nvehicle. To address this, we apply a score-level fusion strategy, which yields\nthe best per-truck performance across most cases. Overall, we achieve an\naccuracy via fusion of TNR=93% (True Negative Rate) and TPR=86.5% (True\nPositive Rate). This research has been part of the BIG FUN project, which\nexplores how Artificial Intelligence can be applied to logged vehicle data to\nunderstand and predict driver behaviour, particularly in relation to Camera\nMonitor Systems (CMS), being introduced as digital replacements for traditional\nexterior mirrors.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8f66\u8f86\u8d85\u8f66\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5c5e\u4e8e\u8f66\u8f86\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8303\u7574\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u6d89\u53ca\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08ANN, RF, SVM\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002BIG FUN\u9879\u76ee\u63a2\u7d22AI\u5728\u8f66\u8f86\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e5f\u6697\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "keywords": ["overtake detection", "vehicle manoeuvre detection", "Artificial Neural Networks", "Random Forest", "Support Vector Machines", "driver behaviour", "trajectory prediction"]}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}
