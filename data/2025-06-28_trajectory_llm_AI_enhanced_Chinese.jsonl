These attacks induce distributional shifts that significantly degrade\nvalue estimation, leading to unsafe or suboptimal decision making rendering the\nexisting policy fragile. To address this vulnerability, we propose an\nantifragile RL framework designed to adapt against curriculum of incremental\nadversarial perturbations. The framework introduces a simulated attacker which\nincrementally increases the strength of observation-space perturbations which\nenables the RL agent to adapt and generalize across a wider range of OOD\nobservations and anticipate previously unseen attacks. We begin with a\ntheoretical characterization of fragility, formally defining catastrophic\nforgetting as a monotonic divergence in value function distributions with\nincreasing perturbation strength. Building on this, we define antifragility as\nthe boundedness of such value shifts and derive adaptation conditions under\nwhich forgetting is stabilized. Our method enforces these bounds through\niterative expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance\nminimization across incrementally perturbed observations. We empirically\nevaluate the approach in a UAV deconfliction scenario involving dynamic 3D\nobstacles. Results show that the antifragile policy consistently outperforms\nstandard and robust RL baselines when subjected to both projected gradient\ndescent (PGD) and GPS spoofing attacks, achieving up to 15% higher cumulative\nreward and over 30% fewer conflict events.
