Motivation: 为了结合廉价且可解释的函数与强大的、可推广的语言模型推理，需要在声明式查询语言中集成LLM。然而，为了受益于像SQL这样的数据库查询语言的优化执行，生成的输出必须与类型检查器和数据库内容强制执行的规则对齐。当前的解决方案通常需要大量的基于LLM的后处理调用，以确保生成的输出和数据库值之间的一致性，这导致了性能瓶颈。

Abstract: The chase is a ubiquitous algorithm in database theory. However, for existential rules (aka tuple-generating dependencies), its termination is not guaranteed, and even undecidable in general. The problem of termination becomes particularly difficult for the restricted (or standard) chase, for which the order of rule application matters. Thus, decidability of restricted chase termination is still open for many well-behaved classes such as linear or guarded multi-headed rules. We make a step forward by showing that all-instances restricted chase termination is decidable in the linear multi-headed case.

Abstract: Semantic parsing methods for converting text to SQL queries enable question answering over structured data and can greatly benefit analysts who routinely perform complex analytics on vast data stored in specialized relational databases. Although several benchmarks measure the abilities of text to SQL, the complexity of their questions is inherently limited by the level of expressiveness in query languages and none focus explicitly on questions involving complex analytical reasoning which require operations such as calculations over aggregate analytics, time series analysis or scenario understanding. In this paper, we introduce STARQA, the first public human-created dataset of complex analytical reasoning questions and answers on three specialized-domain databases. In addition to generating SQL directly using LLMs, we evaluate a novel approach (Text2SQLCode) that decomposes the task into a combination of SQL and Python: SQL is responsible for data fetching, and Python more naturally performs reasoning. Our results demonstrate that identifying and combining the abilities of SQL and Python is beneficial compared to using SQL alone, yet the dataset still remains quite challenging for the existing state-of-the-art LLMs.

Abstract: During the early days of relational database theory it was realized that "acyclic" database schemas possess a number of desirable semantic properties. In fact, three different notions of "acyclicity" were identified and extensively investigated during the 1980s, namely, alpha-acyclicity, beta-acyclicity, and gamma-acyclicity. Much more recently, the study of alpha-acyclicity was extended to annotated relations, where the annotations are values from some positive commutative monoid. The recent results about alpha-acyclic schemas and annotated relations give rise to results about beta-acyclic schemas and annotated relations, since a schema is beta-acyclic if and only if every sub-schema of it is alpha-acyclic. Here, we study gamma-acyclic schemas and annotated relations. Our main finding is that the desirable semantic properties of gamma-acyclic schemas extend to annotated relations, provided the annotations come from a positive commutative monoid that has the transportation property. Furthermore, the results reported here shed light on the role of the join of two standard relations, Specifically, our results reveal that the only relevant property of the join of two standard relations is that it is a witness to the consistency of the two relations, provided that these two relations are consistent. For the more abstract setting of annotated relations, this property of the standard join is captured by the notion of a consistency witness function, a notion which we systematically investigate in this work.

Abstract: The explosive growth of multimodal data - spanning text, image, video, spatial, and relational modalities, coupled with the need for real-time semantic search and retrieval over these data - has outpaced the capabilities of existing multimodal and real-time database systems, which either lack efficient ingestion and continuous query capability, or fall short in supporting expressive hybrid analytics. We introduce ARCADE, a real-time data system that efficiently supports high-throughput ingestion and expressive hybrid and continuous query processing across diverse data types. ARCADE introduces unified disk-based secondary index on LSM-based storage for vector, spatial, and text data modalities, a comprehensive cost-based query optimizer for hybrid queries, and an incremental materialized view framework for efficient continuous queries. Built on open-source RocksDB storage and MySQL query engine, ARCADE outperforms leading multimodal data systems by up to 7.4x on read-heavy and 1.4x on write-heavy workloads.

Abstract: Conjunctive Regular Path Queries, or CRPQs for short, are an essential construct in graph query languages. In this paper, we propose the first output-sensitive algorithm for evaluating acyclic CRPQs. It is output-sensitive in the sense that its complexity is a function of the sizes of the input graph and of the query output. In particular, it does not depend on the output sizes of the regular expressions that appear in the query, as these sizes can be much larger than the query output size.   Our algorithm proceeds in two stages. In the first stage, it contracts the given query into a free-connex acyclic one such that the output of the original query can be obtained from the output of the contracted one. This contraction removes bound variables by composing regular expressions or by promoting bound variables to free ones. The minimum necessary number of promoted bound variables gives the contraction width, which is a novel parameter specific to CRPQs. In the second stage, our algorithm evaluates the free-connex acyclic CRPQ and projects away the columns of the promoted bound variables. It ensures output-sensitivity by computing the calibrated outputs of the regular expressions appearing in the free-connex acyclic CRPQ in time proportional to their sizes.   Our algorithm has lower complexity than the state-of-the-art approaches for problem instances where (i) the query output is asymptotically smaller than the worst-case output size or (ii) the largest output size of any of the regular expression in the query.

Abstract: Vector search powers transformers technology, but real-world use demands hybrid queries that combine vector similarity with attribute filters (e.g., "top document in category X, from 2023"). Current solutions trade off recall, speed, and flexibility, relying on fragile index hacks that don't scale. We introduce FusedANN (Fused Attribute-Vector Nearest Neighbor), a geometric framework that elevates filtering to ANN optimization constraints and introduces a convex fused space via a Lagrangian-like relaxation. Our method jointly embeds attributes and vectors through transformer-based convexification, turning hard filters into continuous, weighted penalties that preserve top-k semantics while enabling efficient approximate search. We prove that FusedANN reduces to exact filtering under high selectivity, gracefully relaxes to semantically nearest attributes when exact matches are insufficient, and preserves downstream ANN alpha-approximation guarantees. Empirically, FusedANN improves query throughput by eliminating brittle filtering stages, achieving superior recall-latency tradeoffs on standard hybrid benchmarks without specialized index hacks, delivering up to 3 times higher throughput and better recall than state-of-the-art hybrid and graph-based systems. Theoretically, we provide explicit error bounds and parameter selection rules that make FusedANN practical for production. This establishes a principled, scalable, and verifiable bridge between symbolic constraints and vector similarity, unlocking a new generation of filtered retrieval systems for large, hybrid, and dynamic NLP/ML workloads.
