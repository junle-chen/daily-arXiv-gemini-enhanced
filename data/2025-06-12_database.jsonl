However, their data awareness -- the ability to recognize,\nreason over, and appropriately handle data artifacts such as missing values,\noutliers, and logical inconsistencies -- remains underexplored. These artifacts\nare especially common in real-world tabular data and, if mishandled, can\nsignificantly compromise the validity of analytical conclusions. To address\nthis gap, we present RADAR, a benchmark for systematically evaluating\ndata-aware reasoning on tabular data. We develop a framework to simulate data\nartifacts via programmatic perturbations to enable targeted evaluation of model\nbehavior. RADAR comprises 2980 table query pairs, grounded in real-world data\nspanning 9 domains and 5 data artifact types. In addition to evaluating\nartifact handling, RADAR systematically varies table size to study how\nreasoning performance holds when increasing table size. Our evaluation reveals\nthat, despite decent performance on tables without data artifacts, frontier\nmodels degrade significantly when data artifacts are introduced, exposing\ncritical gaps in their capacity for robust, data-aware analysis. Designed to be\nflexible and extensible, RADAR supports diverse perturbation types and\ncontrollable table sizes, offering a valuable resource for advancing tabular\nreasoning."}

Recently, there is a growing demand\nto support these capabilities over personal data stored locally on devices.\nHowever, maintaining the necessary data structure associated with the\nembedding-based search is often infeasible due to its high storage overhead.\nFor example, indexing 100 GB of raw data requires 150 to 700 GB of storage,\nmaking local deployment impractical. Reducing this overhead while maintaining\nsearch quality and latency becomes a critical challenge. In this paper, we\npresent LEANN, a storage-efficient approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search\nindex optimized for resource-constrained personal devices. LEANN combines a\ncompact graph-based structure with an efficient on-the-fly recomputation\nstrategy to enable fast and accurate retrieval with minimal storage overhead.\nOur evaluation shows that LEANN reduces index size to under 5% of the original\nraw data, achieving up to 50 times smaller storage than standard indexes, while\nmaintaining 90% top-3 recall in under 2 seconds on real-world question\nanswering benchmarks."}

However, as data volumes grow, efficiently querying\nlarge-scale databases becomes increasingly challenging. To address this, recent\nstudies attempted to integrate learned indexes into LSM-trees to enhance lookup\nperformance, which has demonstrated promising improvements. Despite this, only\na limited range of learned index types has been considered, and the strengths\nand weaknesses of different learned indexes remain unclear, making them\ndifficult for practical use. To fill this gap, we provide a comprehensive and\nsystematic benchmark to pursue an in-depth understanding of learned indexes in\nLSM-tree systems. In this work, we summarize the workflow of 8 existing learned\nindexes and analyze the associated theoretical cost. We also identify several\nkey factors that significantly influence the performance of learned indexes and\nconclude them with a novel configuration space, including various index types,\nboundary positions, and granularity. Moreover, we implement different learned\nindex designs on a unified platform to evaluate across various configurations.\nSurprisingly, our experiments reveal several unexpected insights, such as the\nmarginal lookup enhancement when allocating a large memory budget to learned\nindexes and modest retraining overhead of learned indexes. Besides, we also\noffer practical guidelines to help developers intelligently select and tune\nlearned indexes for custom use cases."}

However, despite the creation of more than a thousand\nknowledge graphs (KGs) under the W3C standard RDF, their rich semantic\ninformation has not yet been fully leveraged in GNN-based recommender systems.\nTo address this gap, we propose a comprehensive integration of RDF KGs with\nGNNs that utilizes both the topological information from RDF object properties\nand the content information from RDF datatype properties. Our main focus is an\nin-depth evaluation of various GNNs, analyzing how different semantic feature\ninitializations and types of graph structure heterogeneity influence their\nperformance in recommendation tasks. Through experiments across multiple\nrecommendation scenarios involving multi-million-node RDF graphs, we\ndemonstrate that harnessing the semantic richness of RDF KGs significantly\nimproves recommender systems and lays the groundwork for GNN-based recommender\nsystems for the Linked Open Data cloud.

Existing approaches mainly rely on predefined rewrite\nrules, but they handle a limited subset of queries and can cause performance\nregressions. This limitation stems from three challenges of rule-based query\nrewrite: (1) it is hard to discover and verify new rules, (2) fixed rewrite\nrules do not generalize to new query patterns, and (3) some rewrite techniques\ncannot be expressed as fixed rules. Motivated by the fact that human experts\nexhibit significantly better rewrite ability but suffer from scalability, and\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated nearly human-level semantic and\nreasoning abilities, we propose a new approach of using LLMs to rewrite SQL\nqueries beyond rules. Due to the hallucination problems in LLMs, directly\napplying LLMs often leads to nonequivalent and suboptimal queries. To address\nthis issue, we propose QUITE (query rewrite), a training-free and\nfeedback-aware system based on LLM agents that rewrites SQL queries into\nsemantically equivalent forms with significantly better performance, covering a\nbroader range of query patterns and rewrite strategies compared to rule-based\nmethods. Firstly, we design a multi-agent framework controlled by a finite\nstate machine (FSM) to equip LLMs with the ability to use external tools and\nenhance the rewrite process with real-time database feedback. Secondly, we\ndevelop a rewrite middleware to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate\noptimized query equivalents. Finally, we employ a novel hint injection\ntechnique to improve execution plans for rewritten queries. Extensive\nexperiments show that QUITE reduces query execution time by up to 35.8% over\nstate-of-the-art approaches and produces 24.1% more rewrites than prior\nmethods, covering query cases that earlier systems did not handle."}
