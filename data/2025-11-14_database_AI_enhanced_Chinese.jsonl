Their minimal structure enables exceptionally fast access times, scalability, and flexibility in storing diverse data types, making them ideal for high-performance applications such as caching, session management, and distributed systems. As modern computing increasingly demands responsiveness and scalability, key-value stores have become a critical component of the data infrastructure in both industry and research contexts. In this work, we present FlashMap, a high-performance key-value store optimized for Flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs).

Key tasks in this process, such as schema matching and entity resolution, are essential but often require significant effort. Although previous studies have aimed to automate these tasks, the influence of dataset characteristics on the matching effectiveness has not been thoroughly examined, and combinations of different methods remain limited. This study introduces a contextual graph embedding technique that integrates structural details from tabular data and contextual elements such as column descriptions and external knowledge. Tests conducted on datasets with varying properties such as domain specificity, data size, missing rate, and overlap rate showed that our approach consistently surpassed existing graph-based methods, especially in difficult scenarios such those with a high proportion of numerical values or significant missing data. However, we identified specific failure cases, such as columns that were semantically similar but distinct, which remains a challenge for our method. The study highlights two main insights: (i) contextual embeddings enhance the matching reliability, and (ii) dataset characteristics significantly affect the integration outcomes. These contributions can advance the development of practical data integration systems that can support real-world enterprise applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}

Existing GNN-based path embedding (GNN-PE) frameworks achieve efficient exact matching on single machines but lack scalability and optimization for distributed environments. To address this gap, we propose three core innovations to extend GNN-PE to distributed systems: (1) a lightweight dynamic correlation-aware load balancing and hot migration mechanism that fuses multi-dimensional metrics (CPU, communication, memory) and guarantees index consistency; (2) an online incremental learning-based multi-GPU collaborative dynamic caching strategy with heterogeneous GPU adaptation and graph-structure-aware replacement; (3) a query plan ranking method driven by dominance embedding pruning potential (PE-score) that optimizes execution order.

However, existing systems are limited when handling a large number of moving objects and real time spatial queries. In this work, we architect a scalable and efficient system CheetahGIS to process streaming spatial queries over massive moving objects. In particular, CheetahGIS is built upon Apache Flink Stateful Functions (StateFun), an API for building distributed streaming applications with an actor-like model. CheetahGIS enjoys excellent scalability due to its modular architecture, which clearly decomposes different components and allows scaling individual components. To improve the efficiency and scalability of CheetahGIS, we devise a suite of optimizations, e.g., lightweight global grid-based index, metadata synchroniza tion strategies, and load balance mechanisms. We also formulate a generic paradigm for spatial query processing in CheetahGIS, and verify its generality by processing three representative streaming queries (i.e., object query, range count query, and k nearest neighbor query). We conduct extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets to evaluate CheetahGIS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}
