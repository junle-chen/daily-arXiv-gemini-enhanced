At the\nheart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires\nsimultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing\npath search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to\ncity-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and\ncoupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose\nCityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle\nnavigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which\ncoordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local\nnavigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global\ndirectives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative\nreasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a\ndual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while\nshared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.\nExtensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to\n1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate\nthat CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based\nbaselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our\nresults highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and\ncooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for\nintelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments.
