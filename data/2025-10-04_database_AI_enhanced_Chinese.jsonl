Classical\nconfidence-interval cuts such as Clopper-Pearson or Wilson provide lower bounds\non recall, but they routinely overshoot the target by several percentage points\nand exhibit high run-to-run variance under skewed score distributions. We\npresent an end-to-end framework that achieves exact recall with sub-percent\nvariance over tens of millions of geometry pairs, while remaining TPU-friendly.\nOur pipeline starts with an equigrid bounding-box filter and compressed sparse\nrow (CSR) candidate representation, reducing pair enumeration by two orders of\nmagnitude. A deterministic xxHash bootstrap sample trains a lightweight neural\nranker; its scores are propagated to all remaining pairs via a single forward\npass and used to construct a reproducible, score-decile-stratified calibration\nset. Four complementary threshold estimators - Clopper-Pearson, Jeffreys,\nWilson, and an exact quantile - are aggregated via inverse-variance weighting,\nthen fused across nine independent subsamples. This ensemble reduces threshold\nvariance compared to any single method. Evaluated on two real cadastral\ndatasets (approximately 6.31M and 67.34M pairs), our approach consistently hits\na recall target within a small error, decreases redundant verifications\nrelative to other calibrations, and runs end-to-end on a single TPU v3 core.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}
