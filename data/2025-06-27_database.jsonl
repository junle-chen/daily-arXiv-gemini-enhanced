Each server has considerable compute power making it possible to push\ndata reduction operations (selection, projection, and aggregation) close to\nstorage. This paper describes the design and implementation of near data\nprocessing (NDP) in Taurus. NDP has several benefits: it reduces the amount of\ndata shipped over the network; frees up CPU capacity in the compute layer; and\nreduces query run time, thereby enabling higher system throughput. Experiments\nwith the TPCH benchmark (100 GB) showed that 18 out of 22 queries benefited\nfrom NDP; data shipped was reduced by 63 percent; and CPU time by 50 percent.\nOn Q15 the impact was even higher: data shipped was reduced by 98 percent; CPU\ntime by 91 percent; and run time by 80 percent."}

Among these, error-bounded Piecewise Linear Approximation\n($\\epsilon$-PLA) has emerged as a popular choice due to its simplicity and\neffectiveness. Despite its central role in many learned indexes, the design and\nanalysis of $\\epsilon$-PLA fitting algorithms remain underexplored. In this\npaper, we revisit $\\epsilon$-PLA from both theoretical and empirical\nperspectives, with a focus on its application in learned index structures. We\nfirst establish a fundamentally improved lower bound of $\\Omega(\\kappa \\cdot\n\\epsilon^2)$ on the expected segment coverage for existing $\\epsilon$-PLA\nfitting algorithms, where $\\kappa$ is a data-dependent constant. We then\npresent a comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art $\\epsilon$-PLA algorithms\nwhen used in different learned data structures. Our results highlight key\ntrade-offs among model accuracy, model size, and query performance, providing\nactionable guidelines for the principled design of future learned data\nstructures."}

We introduce DIM-SUM, a preprocessing framework for\ntraining robust imputation models that bridges the gap between artificially\nmasked training data and real missing patterns. DIM-SUM combines pattern\nclustering and adaptive masking strategies with theoretical learning guarantees\nto handle diverse missing patterns actually observed in the data. Through\nextensive experiments on over 2 billion readings from California water\ndistricts, electricity datasets, and benchmarks, we demonstrate that DIM-SUM\noutperforms traditional methods by reaching similar accuracy with lower\nprocessing time and significantly less training data. When compared against a\nlarge pre-trained model, DIM-SUM averages 2x higher accuracy with significantly\nless inference time."}

This paper benchmarks five state-of-the-art object detection\narchitectures on three annotated datasets representing a spectrum of\ncodicological complexity: The e-NDP, a corpus of Parisian medieval registers\n(1326-1504); CATMuS, a diverse multiclass dataset derived from various medieval\nand modern sources (ca.12th-17th centuries) and HORAE, a corpus of decorated\nbooks of hours (ca.13th-16th centuries). We evaluate two Transformer-based\nmodels (Co-DETR, Grounding DINO) against three YOLO variants (AABB, OBB, and\nYOLO-World). Our findings reveal significant performance variations dependent\non model architecture, data set characteristics, and bounding box\nrepresentation. In the e-NDP dataset, Co-DETR achieves state-of-the-art results\n(0.752 mAP@.50:.95), closely followed by YOLOv11X-OBB (0.721). Conversely, on\nthe more complex CATMuS and HORAE datasets, the CNN-based YOLOv11x-OBB\nsignificantly outperforms all other models (0.564 and 0.568, respectively).\nThis study unequivocally demonstrates that using Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB)\nis not a minor refinement but a fundamental requirement for accurately modeling\nthe non-Cartesian nature of historical manuscripts. We conclude that a key\ntrade-off exists between the global context awareness of Transformers, ideal\nfor structured layouts, and the superior generalization of CNN-OBB models for\nvisually diverse and complex documents."}
