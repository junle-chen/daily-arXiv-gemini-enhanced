Today, databases treat these simulators as external pre-processing steps. Analysts must manually run a simulation, export the results, and load them into a database before analysis can begin. This linear workflow is inefficient, incurs high latency, and hinders interactive exploration, especially when the analysis itself dictates the need for new or refined simulation data.\n  We envision a new database paradigm, entitled GenIE, that seamlessly integrates multiple simulators into databases to enable dynamic orchestration of simulation workflows. By making the database \"simulation-aware,\" GenIE can dynamically invoke simulators with appropriate parameters based on the user's query and analytical needs. This tight integration allows GenIE to avoid generating data irrelevant to the analysis, reuse previously generated data, and support iterative, incremental analysis where results are progressively refined at interactive speeds.\n  We present our vision for GenIE, designed as an extension to PostgreSQL, and demonstrate its potential benefits through comprehensive use cases: wildfire smoke dispersion analysis using WRF-SFIRE and HYSPLIT, and hurricane hazard assessment integrating wind, surge, and flood models. Our preliminary experiments show how GenIE can transform these slow, static analyses into interactive explorations by intelligently managing the trade-off between simulation accuracy and runtime across multiple integrated simulators. We conclude by highlighting the challenges and opportunities ahead in realizing the full vision of GenIE as a cornerstone for next-generation scientific data analysis."}

As adoption has grown, the diversity of workloads has introduced increasingly sophisticated needs for sandboxing. To address these evolving requirements, Snowpark transitioned its in-house sandboxing solution to gVisor, augmented with targeted optimizations. This paper describes both the functional and performance objectives that guided the upgrade, outlines the new sandbox architecture, and details the challenges encountered during the journey, along with the solutions developed to resolve them. Finally, we present case studies that highlight new features enabled by the upgraded architecture, demonstrating SEE's extensibility and flexibility in supporting the next generation of Snowpark workloads."}

In this paper, we introduce Redbench, a novel benchmark featuring a workload generator that reproduces real-world workload characteristics derived from traces released by cloud providers. Redbench integrates multiple workload generation techniques to tailor workloads to specific objectives, transforming existing benchmarks into realistic query streams that preserve intrinsic workload characteristics. By focusing on inherent workload signals rather than execution-specific metrics, Redbench bridges the gap between synthetic and real workloads. Our evaluation shows that (1) Redbench produces more realistic and reproducible workloads for cloud data warehouse benchmarking, and (2) Redbench reveals the impact of system optimizations across four commercial data warehouse platforms. We believe that Redbench provides a crucial foundation for advancing research on optimization techniques for modern cloud data warehouses."}

By adopting globally recognized ontologies and interoperable data standards, Brazil Data Commons aligns with the principles of the broader Data Commons ecosystem and places Brazilian data in a global context. Through user-friendly interfaces, straightforward query mechanisms and flexible data access options, the platform democratizes data use and enables researchers, policy makers, and the public to gain meaningful insights and make informed decisions. This paper illustrates how Brazil Data Commons transforms scattered datasets into an integrated and easily navigable resource that allows a deeper understanding of Brazil's complex social, economic and environmental landscape."}

Under review", "summary": "Smart cities and pervasive IoT deployments have generated interest in IoT data analysis across transportation and urban planning. At the same time, Large Language Models offer a new interface for exploring IoT data - particularly through natural language. Users today face two key challenges when working with IoT data using LLMs: (1) data collection infrastructure is expensive, producing terabytes of low-level sensor readings that are too granular for direct use, and (2) data analysis is slow, requiring iterative effort and technical expertise. Directly feeding all IoT telemetry to LLMs is impractical due to finite context windows, prohibitive token costs at scale, and non-interactive latencies. What is missing is a system that first parses a user's query to identify the analytical task, then selects the relevant data slices, and finally chooses the right representation before invoking an LLM.\n  We present Flash-Fusion, an end-to-end edge-cloud system that reduces the IoT data collection and analysis burden on users. Two principles guide its design: (1) edge-based statistical summarization (achieving 73.5% data reduction) to address data volume, and (2) cloud-based query planning that clusters behavioral data and assembles context-rich prompts to address data interpretation. We deploy Flash-Fusion on a university bus fleet and evaluate it against a baseline that feeds raw data to a state-of-the-art LLM. Flash-Fusion achieves a 95% latency reduction and 98% decrease in token usage and cost while maintaining high-quality responses. It enables personas across disciplines - safety officers, urban planners, fleet managers, and data scientists - to efficiently iterate over IoT data without the burden of manual query authoring or preprocessing."}

Jensen"], "title": "MovSemCL: Movement-Semantics Contrastive Learning for Trajectory Similarity", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.DB"], "comment": "8 pages, 6 figures; accepted by AAAI 2026 as an Oral paper", "summary": "Trajectory similarity computation is fundamental functionality that is used for, e.g., clustering, prediction, and anomaly detection. However, existing learning-based methods exhibit three key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of trajectory semantics and hierarchy, lacking both movement dynamics extraction and multi-scale structural representation; (2) high computational costs due to point-wise encoding; and (3) use of physically implausible augmentations that distort trajectory semantics. To address these issues, we propose MovSemCL, a movement-semantics contrastive learning framework for trajectory similarity computation. MovSemCL first transforms raw GPS trajectories into movement-semantics features and then segments them into patches. Next, MovSemCL employs intra- and inter-patch attentions to encode local as well as global trajectory patterns, enabling efficient hierarchical representation and reducing computational costs. Moreover, MovSemCL includes a curvature-guided augmentation strategy that preserves informative segments (e.g., turns and intersections) and masks redundant ones, generating physically plausible augmented views. Experiments on real-world datasets show that MovSemCL is capable of outperforming state-of-the-art methods, achieving mean ranks close to the ideal value of 1 at similarity search tasks and improvements by up to 20.3% at heuristic approximation, while reducing inference latency by up to 43.4%."}

However, the multi-stage pipeline (retrieve, generate) and unique workload characteristics (e.g., knowledge dependency) of RAG systems pose significant challenges for serving performance optimization. Existing generic LLM inference traces fail to capture these RAG-specific dynamics, creating a significant performance gap between academic research and real-world deployment. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces RAGPulse, an open-source RAG workload trace dataset. This dataset was collected from an university-wide Q&A system serving that has served more than 40,000 students and faculties since April 2024. We detail RAGPulse's system architecture, its privacy-preserving hash-based data format, and provide an in-depth statistical analysis. Our analysis reveals that real-world RAG workloads exhibit significant temporal locality and a highly skewed hot document access pattern. RAGPulse provides a high-fidelity foundation for researchers to develop and validate novel optimization strategies for RAG systems, such as content-aware batching and retrieval caching, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and reliability of RAG services.

We introduce ZX-DB, a data-driven system that performs quantum circuit simplification and rewriting inside a graph database using ZX-calculus, a complete graphical formalism for quantum mechanics. ZX-DB encodes ZX-calculus rewrite rules as standard openCypher queries and executes them on an example graph database engine, Memgraph, enabling efficient, database-native transformations of large-scale quantum circuits. ZX-DB integrates correctness validation via tensor and graph equivalence checks and is evaluated against the state-of-the-art PyZX framework. Experimental results show that ZX-DB achieves up to an order-of-magnitude speedup for independent rewrites, while exposing pattern-matching bottlenecks in current graph database engines. By uniting quantum compilation and graph data management, ZX-DB opens a new systems direction toward scalable, database-supported quantum computing pipelines."}

While exact optimization methods like Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) can ensure coherence, their computational complexity is often prohibitive. Conversely, simpler greedy heuristics that optimize for query coverage alone often fail to find these coherent, joinable sets. This paper frames multi-table retrieval as an iterative search process, arguing this approach offers advantages in scalability, interpretability, and flexibility. We propose a general framework and a concrete instantiation: a fast, effective Greedy Join-Aware Retrieval algorithm that holistically balances relevance, coverage, and joinability. Experiments across 5 NL2SQL benchmarks demonstrate that our iterative method achieves competitive retrieval performance compared to the MIP-based approach while being 4-400x faster depending on the benchmark and search space settings. This work highlights the potential of iterative heuristics for practical, scalable, and composition-aware retrieval."}
