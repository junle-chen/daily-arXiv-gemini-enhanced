Could we directly convert large-scale human motion into\nrobot-executable motion through a more efficient approach? To address this\nissue, we propose Implicit Kinodynamic Motion Retargeting (IKMR), a novel\nefficient and scalable retargeting framework that considers both kinematics and\ndynamics. In kinematics, IKMR pretrains motion topology feature representation\nand a dual encoder-decoder architecture to learn a motion domain mapping. In\ndynamics, IKMR integrates imitation learning with the motion retargeting\nnetwork to refine motion into physically feasible trajectories. After\nfine-tuning using the tracking results, IKMR can achieve large-scale physically\nfeasible motion retargeting in real time, and a whole-body controller could be\ndirectly trained and deployed for tracking its retargeted trajectories. We\nconduct our experiments both in the simulator and the real robot on a full-size\nhumanoid robot. Extensive experiments and evaluation results verify the\neffectiveness of our proposed framework.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "The paper focuses on motion retargeting for humanoid robots, which involves trajectory generation and control.
