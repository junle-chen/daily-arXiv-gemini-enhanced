Recently,\nlarge language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems,\nwhich treat the next POI prediction in a generative manner.

Moreover, in\nindustrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and\nalignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays,\nand users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance\nthe user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address\nthese issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a\nframework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the\nincorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns,\nprofiles, and situational information.

While compliant robot-human\ncollaboration has been extensively developed for robotic arms, enabling\ncompliant human-humanoid collaboration remains largely unexplored due to\nhumanoids' complex whole-body dynamics. In this paper, we propose a\nproprioception-only reinforcement learning approach, COLA, that combines leader\nand follower behaviors within a single policy. The model is trained in a\nclosed-loop environment with dynamic object interactions to predict object\nmotion patterns and human intentions implicitly, enabling compliant\ncollaboration to maintain load balance through coordinated trajectory planning.\nWe evaluate our approach through comprehensive simulator and real-world\nexperiments on collaborative carrying tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness,\ngeneralization, and robustness of our model across various terrains and\nobjects. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our model reduces human effort\nby 24.7%. compared to baseline approaches while maintaining object stability.\nReal-world experiments validate robust collaborative carrying across different\nobject types (boxes, desks, stretchers, etc.) and movement patterns\n(straight-line, turning, slope climbing). Human user studies with 23\nparticipants confirm an average improvement of 27.4% compared to baseline\nmodels. Our method enables compliant human-humanoid collaborative carrying\nwithout requiring external sensors or complex interaction models, offering a\npractical solution for real-world deployment.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "The paper focuses on human-humanoid collaboration for object carrying, which involves trajectory planning and prediction of object motion and human intentions.

However,\nscaling up VLA models presents several critical challenges: (1) Training new\nVLA models from scratch demands substantial computational resources and\nextensive datasets. Given the current scarcity of robot data, it becomes\nparticularly valuable to fully leverage well-pretrained VLA model weights\nduring the scaling process. (2) Real-time control requires carefully balancing\nmodel capacity with computational efficiency. To address these challenges, We\npropose AdaMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that inherits\npretrained weights from dense VLA models, and scales up the action expert by\nsubstituting the feedforward layers into sparsely activated MoE layers. AdaMoE\nemploys a decoupling technique that decouples expert selection from expert\nweighting through an independent scale adapter working alongside the\ntraditional router. This enables experts to be selected based on task relevance\nwhile contributing with independently controlled weights, allowing\ncollaborative expert utilization rather than winner-takes-all dynamics. Our\napproach demonstrates that expertise need not monopolize. Instead, through\ncollaborative expert utilization, we can achieve superior performance while\nmaintaining computational efficiency. AdaMoE consistently outperforms the\nbaseline model across key benchmarks, delivering performance gains of 1.8% on\nLIBERO and 9.3% on RoboTwin. Most importantly, a substantial 21.5% improvement\nin real-world experiments validates its practical effectiveness for robotic\nmanipulation tasks.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6,

We present GOPLA, a hierarchical framework that\nlearns generalizable object placement from augmented human demonstrations. A\nmulti-modal large language model translates human instructions and visual\ninputs into structured plans that specify pairwise object relationships. These\nplans are then converted into 3D affordance maps with geometric common sense by\na spatial mapper, while a diffusion-based planner generates placement poses\nguided by test-time costs, considering multi-plan distributions and collision\navoidance. To overcome data scarcity, we introduce a scalable pipeline that\nexpands human placement demonstrations into diverse synthetic training data.\nExtensive experiments show that our approach improves placement success rates\nby 30.04 percentage points over the runner-up, evaluated on positioning\naccuracy and physical plausibility, demonstrating strong generalization across\na wide range of real-world robotic placement scenarios.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "The paper uses a large language model to translate human instructions into structured plans for object placement.

Despite the success of large language models and vision language\nmodels based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue\nfacing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex\nreal-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning\ncapabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models\nto robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor\ngeneralization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1,\na two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework,\nsupervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences,\nfollowed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial\nunderstanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action\nsequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based\nreward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and\naction constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on\nQwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini,\nby 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the\nEmbodiedBench benchmark.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "The paper focuses on robot planning and uses a large language model (Qwen2.5-VL-3B) for reasoning.
