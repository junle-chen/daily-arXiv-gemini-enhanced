Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos\noffers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and\nsimplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While\nimitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert\ndemonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements,\nlearning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios.\nTo address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with\nEquivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models\nexpert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the\nstochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual\nrepresentation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a\ndiffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and\nsampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization.\nAdditionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric\nsymmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address\nstate mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy\nfor conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips,\nexperimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods,\nboth explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical\nskill development for dissection trajectory prediction.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.7, "explanation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4e8e\u4ece\u4e13\u5bb6\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u5256\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u5728\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4e5f\u5c5e\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u3002", "keywords": ["trajectory prediction", "imitation learning", "diffusion model", "surgical skill development", "dissection trajectories"]}}
