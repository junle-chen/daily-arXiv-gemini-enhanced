In this paper, we study how to enable\ncomputer-use agents to learn from online videos at inference time effectively.\nWe propose a framework that retrieves and filters tutorial videos, converts\nthem into structured demonstration trajectories, and dynamically selects\ntrajectories as in-context guidance during execution. Particularly, using a\nVLM, we infer UI actions, segment videos into short subsequences of actions,\nand assign each subsequence a textual objective. At inference time, a two-stage\nselection mechanism dynamically chooses a single trajectory to add in context\nat each step, focusing the agent on the most helpful local guidance for its\nnext decision. Experiments on two widely used benchmarks show that our\nframework consistently outperforms strong base agents and variants that use\nonly textual tutorials or transcripts.

Cooperation\nunfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose\ncandidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under\nconsensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent\nindependently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without\nrevealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a\nshared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.\nBy reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR.
