Abstract: Information systems support the execution of business processes. The event logs of these executions generally contain sensitive information about customers, patients, and employees. The corresponding privacy challenges can be addressed by anonymizing the event logs while still retaining utility for process discovery. However, trading off utility and privacy is difficult: the higher the complexity of event log, the higher the loss of utility by anonymization. In this work, we propose a pipeline that combines anonymization and event data partitioning, where event abstraction is utilized for partitioning. By leveraging event abstraction, event logs can be segmented into multiple parts, allowing each sub-log to be anonymized separately. This pipeline preserves privacy while mitigating the loss of utility. To validate our approach, we study the impact of event partitioning on two anonymization techniques using three real-world event logs and two process discovery techniques. Our results demonstrate that event partitioning can bring improvements in process discovery utility for directly-follows-based anonymization techniques.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate code from natural language descriptions. Their performance is typically evaluated using programming benchmarks that simulate real-world tasks. These benchmarks provide specifications in the form of docstrings, function signatures, or bug reports. The model then generates a program, which is tested against predefined test cases. In contrast, Programming by Example (PBE) uses input-output examples as the specification. Traditional PBE systems rely on search-based methods over restricted transformation spaces. They are usually designed for narrow domains and fixed input formats. It remains unclear how well LLMs perform on PBE tasks.   In this work, we evaluate LLMs on PBE tasks involving tabular data transformations. We prompt models to generate functions that convert an input table to an output table. We test the generated functions on unseen inputs to measure accuracy. Our study includes multiple LLMs and evaluates different prompting strategies, such as one-shot vs. multi-try. We also compare performance with and without PBE-specific knowledge. Finally, we propose a hybrid method that calls a traditional PBE solver first, and then falls back to LLMs if necessary. Our results show that LLMs support more diverse input formats and achieve higher accuracy than conventional methods. However, they struggle with tasks that contain ambiguity. The hybrid approach improves overall success by combining the strengths of both approaches.

Abstract: Trajectory mining has attracted significant attention. This paper addresses the Top-k Representative Similar Subtrajectory Query (TRSSQ) problem, which aims to find the k most representative subtrajectories similar to a query. Existing methods rely on costly filtering-validation frameworks, resulting in slow response times. Addressing this, we propose GTRSS, a novel Graph-based Top-k Representative Similar Subtrajectory Query framework. During the offline phase, GTRSS builds a dual-layer graph index that clusters trajectories containing similar representative subtrajectories. In the online phase, it efficiently retrieves results by navigating the graph toward query-relevant clusters, bypassing full-dataset scanning and heavy computation. To support this, we introduce the Data Trajectory Similarity Metric (DTSM) to measure the most similar subtrajectory pair. We further combine R-tree and grid filtering with DTSM pruning rules to speed up index building. To the best of our knowledge, GTRSS is the first graph-based solution for top-k subtrajectory search. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that GTRSS significantly enhances both efficiency and accuracy, achieving a retrieval accuracy of over 90 percent and up to two orders of magnitude speedup in query performance.

Abstract: Generative AI is transforming business applications by enabling natural language interfaces and intelligent automation. However, the underlying large language models (LLMs) are evolving rapidly and so prompting them consistently is a challenge. This leads to inconsistent and unpredictable application behavior, undermining the reliability that businesses require for mission-critical workflows. In this paper, we introduce the concept of prompt migration as a systematic approach to stabilizing GenAI applications amid changing LLMs. Using the Tursio enterprise search application as a case study, we analyze the impact of successive GPT model upgrades, detail our migration framework including prompt redesign and a migration testbed, and demonstrate how these techniques restore application consistency. Our results show that structured prompt migration can fully recover the application reliability that was lost due to model drift. We conclude with practical lessons learned, emphasizing the need for prompt lifecycle management and robust testing to ensure dependable GenAI-powered business applications.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal data play a key role for mobility-based applications and are their produced volume is growing continuously, among others, due to the increased availability of IoT devices.   When working with spatiotemporal data, developers rely on spatiotemporal database systems such as PostGIS or MobilityDB.   For better understanding their quality of service behavior and then choosing the best system, benchmarking is the go-to approach.   Unfortunately, existing work in this field studies only small isolated aspects and a comprehensive application-centric benchmark suite is still missing.   In this paper, we argue that an application-centric benchmark suite for spatiotemporal database systems is urgently needed.   We identify requirements for such a benchmark suite, discuss domain-specific challenges, and sketch-out the architecture of a modular benchmarking suite.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal data are being produced in continuously growing volumes by a variety of data sources and a variety of application fields rely on rapid analysis of such data. Existing systems such as PostGIS or MobilityDB usually build on relational database systems, thus, inheriting their scale-out characteristics. As a consequence, big spatiotemporal data scenarios still have limited support even though many query types can easily be parallelized. In this paper, we propose our vision of a native serverless data processing approach for spatiotemporal data: We break down queries into small subqueries which then leverage the near-instant scaling of Function-as-a-Service platforms to execute them in parallel. With this, we partially solve the scalability needs of big spatiotemporal data processing.

Abstract: Data summarization is essential to discover insights from large datasets. In a spreadsheets, pivot tables offer a convenient way to summarize tabular data by computing aggregates over some attributes, grouped by others. However, identifying attribute combinations that will result in useful pivot tables remains a challenge, especially for high-dimensional datasets. We formalize the problem of automatically recommending insightful and interpretable pivot tables, eliminating the tedious manual process. A crucial aspect of recommending a set of pivot tables is to diversify them. Traditional works inadequately address the table-diversification problem, which leads us to consider the problem of pivot table diversification.   We present SAGE, a data-semantics-aware system for recommending k-budgeted diverse pivot tables, overcoming the shortcomings of prior work for top-k recommendations that cause redundancy. SAGE ensures that each pivot table is insightful, interpretable, and adaptive to the user's actions and preferences, while also guaranteeing that the set of pivot tables are different from each other, offering a diverse recommendation. We make two key technical contributions: (1) a data-semantics-aware model to measure the utility of a single pivot table and the diversity of a set of pivot tables, and (2) a scalable greedy algorithm that can efficiently select a set of diverse pivot tables of high utility, by leveraging data semantics to significantly reduce the combinatorial search space. Our extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that SAGE outperforms alternative approaches, and efficiently scales to accommodate high-dimensional datasets. Additionally, we present several case studies to highlight SAGE's qualitative effectiveness over commercial software and Large Language Models (LLMs).

Abstract: Database research and development often require a large number of SQL queries for benchmarking purposes. However, acquiring real-world SQL queries is challenging due to privacy concerns, and existing SQL generation methods are limited in customization and in satisfying realistic constraints. To address this issue, we present SQLBarber, a system based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate customized and realistic SQL workloads. SQLBarber (i) eliminates the need for users to manually craft SQL templates in advance, while providing the flexibility to accept natural language specifications to constrain SQL templates, (ii) scales efficiently to generate large volumes of queries matching any user-defined cost distribution (e.g., cardinality and execution plan cost), and (iii) uses execution statistics from Amazon Redshift and Snowflake to derive SQL template specifications and query cost distributions that reflect real-world query characteristics. SQLBarber introduces (i) a declarative interface for users to effortlessly generate customized SQL templates, (ii) an LLM-powered pipeline augmented with a self-correction module that profiles, refines, and prunes SQL templates based on query costs, and (iii) a Bayesian Optimizer to efficiently explore different predicate values and identify a set of queries that satisfy the target cost distribution. We construct and open-source ten benchmarks of varying difficulty levels and target query cost distributions based on real-world statistics from Snowflake and Amazon Redshift. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks show that SQLBarber is the only system that can generate customized SQL templates. It reduces query generation time by one to three orders of magnitude, and significantly improves alignment with the target cost distribution, compared with existing methods.

Abstract: Modern high-performance computing (HPC) systems generate massive volumes of heterogeneous telemetry data from millions of sensors monitoring compute, memory, power, cooling, and storage subsystems. As HPC infrastructures scale to support increasingly complex workloads-including generative AI-the need for efficient, reliable, and interoperable telemetry analysis becomes critical. Operational Data Analytics (ODA) has emerged to address these demands; however, the reliance on schema-less storage solutions limits data accessibility and semantic integration. Ontologies and knowledge graphs (KG) provide an effective way to enable efficient and expressive data querying by capturing domain semantics, but they face challenges such as significant storage overhead and the limited applicability of existing ontologies, which are often tailored to specific HPC systems only. In this paper, we present the first unified ontology for ODA in HPC systems, designed to enable semantic interoperability across heterogeneous data centers. Our ontology models telemetry data from the two largest publicly available ODA datasets-M100 (Cineca, Italy) and F-DATA (Fugaku, Japan)-within a single data model. The ontology is validated through 36 competency questions reflecting real-world stakeholder requirements, and we introduce modeling optimizations that reduce knowledge graph (KG) storage overhead by up to 38.84% compared to a previous approach, with an additional 26.82% reduction depending on the desired deployment configuration. This work paves the way for scalable ODA KGs and supports not only analysis within individual systems, but also cross-system analysis across heterogeneous HPC systems.

Abstract: One of the main challenges within the growing research area of learned indexing is the lack of adaptability to dynamically expanding datasets. This paper explores the dynamization of a static learned index for complex data through operations such as node splitting and broadening, enabling efficient adaptation to new data. Furthermore, we evaluate the trade-offs between static and dynamic approaches by introducing an amortized cost model to assess query performance in tandem with the build costs of the index structure, enabling experimental determination of when a dynamic learned index outperforms its static counterpart. We apply the dynamization method to a static learned index and demonstrate that its superior scaling quickly surpasses the static implementation in terms of overall costs as the database grows. This is an extended version of the paper presented at DAWAK 2025.
