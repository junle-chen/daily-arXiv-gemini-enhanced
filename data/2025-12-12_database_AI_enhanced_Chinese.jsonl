Recent work on data-driven methods has leveraged probabilistic models to achieve higher estimation accuracy, but these approaches cannot guarantee low inference latency at the same time and neglect scalability. As data dimensionality grows, optimization time can even exceed actual query execution time. Furthermore, inference with probabilistic models by sampling or integration procedures unpredictable estimation result and violate stability, which brings unstable performance with query execution and make database tuning hard for database users. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to cardinality estimation based on cumulative distribution function(CDF), which calculates range query cardinality without sampling or integration, ensuring accurate and predictable estimation results. With inference acceleration by merging calculations, we can achieve fast and nearly constant inference speed while maintaining high accuracy, even as dimensionality increases, which is over 10x faster than current state-of-the-art data-driven cardinality estimator. This demonstrates its excellent dimensional scalability, making it well-suited for real-world database applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}

As RAG expands with table-augmented generation to incorporate structured data, workloads integrating table and vector search are becoming more prevalent. However, efficiently executing such queries remains challenging due to inaccurate cardinality estimation for vector search components, leading to suboptimal query plans. In this paper, we propose Exqutor, an extended query optimizer for vector-augmented analytical queries. Exqutor is a pluggable cardinality estimation framework designed to address this issue, leveraging exact cardinality query optimization techniques to enhance estimation accuracy when vector indexes (e.g., HNSW, IVF) are available. In scenarios lacking these indexes, we employ a sampling-based approach with adaptive sampling size adjustment, dynamically tuning the sample size to balance estimation accuracy and sampling overhead. This allows Exqutor to efficiently approximate vector search cardinalities while minimizing computational costs. We integrate our framework into pgvector, VBASE, and DuckDB, demonstrating performance improvements of up to four orders of magnitude on vector-augmented analytical queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}

It is built upon Operational Differencing, a new technique for managing data in terms of high-level operations that include refactorings and schema changes. We use operational differencing to construct an operation-based form of version control on data structures used in programming languages and relational databases. This approach to data version control does fine-grained diffing and merging despite intervening structural transformations like schema changes. It offers users a simplified conceptual model of version control for ad hoc usage: There is no repo; Branching is just copying. The informaton maintained in a repo can be synthesized more precisely from the append-only histories of branches. Branches can be flexibly shared as is commonly done with document files, except with the added benefit of diffing and merging. We conjecture that queries can be operationalized into a sequence of schema and data operations. We develop that idea on a query language fragment containing selects and joins. Operationalized queries are represented as a future timeline that is speculatively executed as a branch off of the present state, returning a value from its hypothetical future. Operationalized queries get rewritten to accommodate schema change \"for free\" by the machinery of operational differencing. Altogether we develop solutions to four of the eight challenge problems of schema evolution identified in a recent paper.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}

This work describes the implementation when using cofactors for in-database factorized learning. We benchmark our open-source implementation for learning linear regression on factorized joins with PostgreSQL -- as a disk-based database system -- and HyPer -- as an in-memory engine. The evaluation shows a performance gain of factorized learning on in-memory database systems by 70\\% to non-factorized learning and by a factor of 100 compared to disk-based database systems.
