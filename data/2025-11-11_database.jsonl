In particular, multi-vector models, which represent a\ntable as a vector set (typically one vector per column), have been demonstrated\nto achieve superior retrieval quality by capturing fine-grained semantic\nalignments. However, this problem faces more severe efficiency challenges than\nthe single-vector problem due to the inherent dependency on bipartite graph\nmaximum matching to compute unionability scores. Therefore, this paper proposes\nan efficient Proximity Graph-based Table Union Search (PGTUS) approach. PGTUS\nemploys a multi-stage pipeline that combines a novel refinement strategy, a\nfiltering strategy based on many-to-one bipartite matching. Besides, we propose\nan enhanced pruning strategy to prune the candidate set, which further improve\nthe search efficiency. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that our approach achieves 3.6-6.0X speedup over existing\napproaches while maintaining comparable recall rates."}
