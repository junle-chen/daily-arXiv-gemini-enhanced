Abstract: To obtain insights from event data, advanced process mining methods assess the similarity of activities to incorporate their semantic relations into the analysis. Here, distributional similarity that captures similarity from activity co-occurrences is commonly employed. However, existing work for distributional similarity in process mining adopt neural network-based approaches as developed for natural language processing, e.g., word2vec and autoencoders. While these approaches have been shown to be effective, their downsides are high computational costs and limited interpretability of the learned representations.   In this work, we argue for simplicity in the modeling of distributional similarity of activities. We introduce count-based embeddings that avoid a complex training process and offer a direct interpretable representation. To underpin our call for simple embeddings, we contribute a comprehensive benchmarking framework, which includes means to assess the intrinsic quality of embeddings, their performance in downstream applications, and their computational efficiency. In experiments that compare against the state of the art, we demonstrate that count-based embeddings provide a highly effective and efficient basis for distributional similarity between activities in event data.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of deep learning models over relational databases, including architectures based on heterogeneous graph neural networks (hetero-GNNs) and heterogeneous graph transformers. In effect, such architectures state how the database records and links (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical expression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it hard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available data to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for explaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where explanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database that mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global abductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash, Segoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between determinacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of granularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones highlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of tuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case of hetero-GNNs. We develop heuristic algorithms that avoid the exhaustive search over the space of all databases. We propose techniques that are model-agnostic, and others that are tailored to hetero-GNNs via the notion of learnable masking. Our approach is evaluated through an extensive empirical study on the RelBench collection, covering a variety of domains and different record-level tasks. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed explanations, as well as the efficiency of their generation.

Abstract: Distributed systems require robust, scalable identifier schemes to ensure data uniqueness and efficient indexing across multiple nodes. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of distributed identifiers, comparing traditional auto-increment keys with UUIDv4, UUIDv7, and ULIDs. We combine mathematical calculation of collision probabilities with empirical experiments measuring generation speed and network transmission overhead in a simulated distributed environment. Results demonstrate that ULIDs significantly outperform UUIDv4 and UUIDv7, reducing network overhead by 83.7% and increasing generation speed by 97.32%. statistical analysis further shows ULIDs offer a 98.42% lower collision risk compared to UUIDv7, while maintaining negligible collision probabilities even at high generation rates. These findings highlight ULIDs as an optimal choice for high-performance distributed systems, providing efficient, time-ordered, and lexicographically sortable identifiers suitable for scalable applications. All source code, datasets, and analysis scripts utilized in this research are publicly available in our dedicated repository at https://github.com/nimakarimiank/uids-comparison. This repository contains comprehensive documentation of the experimental setup, including configuration files for the distributed environment, producer and consumer implementations, and message broker integration. Additionally, it provides the data scripts and datasets. Researchers and practitioners are encouraged to explore the repository for full reproducibility of the experiments and to facilitate further investigation or extension of the presented work.
