Starting from the iRonCub-Mk3 model, a Design of Experiments\n(DoE) approach is used to generate 5,000 geometrically varied and mechanically\nfeasible designs by modifying limb dimensions, jet interface geometry (e.g.,\nangle and offset), and overall mass distribution. Each model is constructed\nthrough CAD assemblies to ensure structural validity and compatibility with\nsimulation tools. To reduce computational cost and enable parameter sensitivity\nanalysis, the models are clustered using K-means, with representative centroids\nselected for evaluation. A minimum-jerk trajectory is used to assess flight\nperformance, providing position and velocity references for a momentum-based\nlinearized Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy. A multi-objective\noptimization is then conducted using the NSGA-II algorithm, jointly exploring\nthe space of design centroids and MPC gain parameters. The objectives are to\nminimize trajectory tracking error and mechanical energy expenditure. The\nframework outputs a set of flight-ready humanoid configurations with validated\ncontrol parameters, offering a structured method for selecting and implementing\nfeasible aerial humanoid designs.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "This paper focuses on trajectory optimization and control for humanoid robots, specifically in the context of flight.

However,\nexisting approaches struggle in complex real-world scenarios: zero-shot\ndetectors rely heavily on scoring model's output distribution while\ntraining-based detectors are often constrained by overfitting to the training\ndata, limiting generalization. We found that the performance bottleneck of\ntraining-based detectors stems from the misalignment between training objective\nand task needs. To address this, we propose Direct Discrepancy Learning (DDL),\na novel optimization strategy that directly optimizes the detector with\ntask-oriented knowledge. DDL enables the detector to better capture the core\nsemantics of the detection task, thereby enhancing both robustness and\ngeneralization. Built upon this, we introduce DetectAnyLLM, a unified detection\nframework that achieves state-of-the-art MGTD performance across diverse LLMs.\nTo ensure a reliable evaluation, we construct MIRAGE, the most diverse\nmulti-task MGTD benchmark. MIRAGE samples human-written texts from 10 corpora\nacross 5 text-domains, which are then re-generated or revised using 17\ncutting-edge LLMs, covering a wide spectrum of proprietary models and textual\nstyles. Extensive experiments on MIRAGE reveal the limitations of existing\nmethods in complex environment. In contrast, DetectAnyLLM consistently\noutperforms them, achieving over a 70% performance improvement under the same\ntraining data and base scoring model, underscoring the effectiveness of our\nDDL.
