Code queries cluster densely in\nembedding space while conversational queries distribute sparsely. Content\nstaleness varies from minutes (stock data) to months (code patterns). Query\nrepetition patterns range from power-law (code) to uniform (conversation),\nproducing long tail cache hit rate distributions: high-repetition categories\nachieve 40-60% hit rates while low-repetition or volatile categories achieve\n5-15% hit rates. Vector databases must exclude the long tail because remote\nsearch costs (30ms) require 15--20% hit rates to break even, leaving 20-30% of\nproduction traffic uncached. Uniform cache policies compound this problem:\nfixed thresholds cause false positives in dense spaces and miss valid\nparaphrases in sparse spaces; fixed TTLs waste memory or serve stale data. This\npaper presents category-aware semantic caching where similarity thresholds,\nTTLs, and quotas vary by query category. We present a hybrid architecture\nseparating in-memory HNSW search from external document storage, reducing miss\ncost from 30ms to 2ms. This reduction makes low-hit-rate categories\neconomically viable (break-even at 3-5% versus 15-20%), enabling cache coverage\nacross the entire workload distribution. Adaptive load-based policies extend\nthis framework to respond to downstream model load, dynamically adjusting\nthresholds and TTLs to reduce traffic to overloaded models by 9-17% in\ntheoretical
