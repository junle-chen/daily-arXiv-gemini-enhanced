However, accessing\nand analyzing structured data often requires proficiency in SQL, which is a\nskill that many end users lack. With the development of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) technology, the Text-to-SQL systems attempt to bridge this gap\nby translating natural language questions into executable SQL queries via an\nautomated algorithm. Yet, when operating on complex real-world databases, the\nText-to-SQL systems often suffer from ambiguity due to natural ambiguity in\nnatural language queries. These ambiguities pose a significant challenge for\nexisting Text-to-SQL translation systems, which tend to commit early to a\npotentially incorrect interpretation. To address this, we propose an\ninteractive Text-to-SQL framework that models SQL generation as a probabilistic\nreasoning process over multiple candidate queries. Rather than producing a\nsingle deterministic output, our system maintains a distribution over possible\nSQL outputs and seeks to resolve uncertainty through user interaction. At each\ninteraction step, the system selects a branching decision and formulates a\nclarification question aimed at disambiguating that aspect of the query.\nCrucially, we adopt a principled decision criterion based on Expected\nInformation Gain to identify the clarification that will, in expectation, most\nreduce the uncertainty in the SQL distribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}

In such systems, LLM-based extraction operations\nconstitute the performance bottleneck of query execution due to the high\nmonetary cost and slow LLM inference. Existing systems typically borrow the\nquery optimization principles popular in relational databases to produce query\nexecution plans, which unfortunately are ineffective in minimizing LLM cost. To\nfill this gap, we propose QUEST, which features a bunch of novel optimization\nstrategies for unstructured document analysis. First, we introduce an\nindex-based strategy to minimize the cost of each extraction operation. With\nthis index, QUEST quickly retrieves the text segments relevant to the target\nattributes and only feeds them to LLMs. Furthermore, we design an\nevidence-augmented retrieval strategy to reduce the possibility of missing\nrelevant segments. Moreover, we develop an instance-optimized query execution\nstrategy: because the attribute extraction cost could vary significantly\ndocument by document, QUEST produces different plans for different documents.\nFor each document, QUEST produces a plan to minimize the frequency of attribute\nextraction. The innovations include LLM cost-aware operator ordering strategies\nand an optimized join execution approach that transforms joins into filters.\nExtensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of\nQUEST, achieving 30%-6x cost savings while improving the F1 score by 10% -27%\ncompared with state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}
