Current research\nremains predominantly constrained to small-scale UAV applications, with most\nstudies focusing on isolated components such as path planning for toy drones,\nwhile lacking comprehensive investigation of medium- and long-range UAV systems\nin real-world operational contexts. Larger UAV platforms introduce distinct\nchallenges, including stringent requirements for airport-based take-off and\nlanding procedures, adherence to complex regulatory frameworks, and specialized\noperational capabilities with elevated mission expectations. This position\npaper presents the Next-Generation LLM for UAV (NeLV) system -- a comprehensive\ndemonstration and automation roadmap for integrating LLMs into multi-scale UAV\noperations. The NeLV system processes natural language instructions to\norchestrate short-, medium-, and long-range UAV missions through five key\ntechnical components: (i) LLM-as-Parser for instruction interpretation, (ii)\nRoute Planner for Points of Interest (POI) determination, (iii) Path Planner\nfor waypoint generation, (iv) Control Platform for executable trajectory\nimplementation, and (v) UAV monitoring. We demonstrate the system's feasibility\nthrough three representative use cases spanning different operational scales:\nmulti-UAV patrol, multi-POI delivery, and multi-hop relocation. Beyond the\ncurrent implementation, we establish a five-level automation taxonomy that\ncharts the evolution from current LLM-as-Parser capabilities (Level 1) to fully\nautonomous LLM-as-Autopilot systems (Level 5), identifying technical\nprerequisites and research challenges at each stage.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.8, "explanation": "This paper discusses the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) operations.
