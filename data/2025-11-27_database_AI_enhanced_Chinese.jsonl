However, real-world adoption remains elusive due to the limited ability of traditional relational query operators to capture query semantics. The emergence of foundation models, particularly the large language models (LLMs), opens up new opportunities to develop flexible, semantic-aware data analytics systems that transcend the relational paradigm.\n  We present Nirvana, a multi-modal data analytics framework that incorporates programmable semantic operators while leveraging both logical and physical query optimization strategies, tailored for LLM-driven semantic query processing. Nirvana addresses two key challenges. First, it features an agentic logical optimizer that uses natural language-specified transformation rules and random-walk-based search to explore vast spaces of semantically equivalent query plans -- far beyond the capabilities of conventional optimizers. Second, it introduces a cost-aware physical optimizer that selects the most effective LLM backend for each operator using a novel improvement-score metric. To further enhance efficiency, Nirvana incorporates computation reuse and evaluation pushdown techniques guided by model capability hypotheses. Experimental evaluations on three real-world benchmarks demonstrate that Nirvana is able to reduce end-to-end runtime by 10%--85% and reduces system processing costs by 76% on average, outperforming state-of-the-art systems at both efficiency and scalability.", "AI": {"tldr":

To appear", "summary": "Diverse types of edge data, such as 2D geo-locations and 3D point clouds, are collected by sensors like lidar and GPS receivers on edge devices. On-device searches, such as k-nearest neighbor (kNN) search and radius search, are commonly used to enable fast analytics and learning technologies, such as k-means dataset simplification using kNN. To maintain high search efficiency, a representative approach is to utilize a balanced multi-way KD-tree (BMKD-tree). However, the index has shown limited gains, mainly due to substantial construction overhead, inflexibility to real-time insertion, and inconsistent query performance. In this paper, we propose UnIS to address the above limitations. We first accelerate the construction process of the BMKD-tree by utilizing the dataset distribution to predict the splitting hyperplanes. To make the continuously generated data searchable, we propose a selective sub-tree rebuilding scheme to accelerate rebalancing during insertion by reducing the number of data points involved. We then propose an auto-selection model to improve query performance by automatically selecting the optimal search strategy among multiple strategies for an arbitrary query task. Experimental results show that UnIS achieves average speedups of 17.96x in index construction, 1.60x in insertion, 7.15x in kNN search, and 1.09x in radius search compared to the BMKD-tree. We further verify its effectiveness in accelerating dataset simplification on edge devices, achieving a speedup of 217x over Lloyd's algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}

While edge-DP, which protects privacy at the edge level, has been extensively studied, node-DP, offering stronger protection for entire nodes and their incident edges, remains largely underexplored due to its technical challenges. A natural way to bridge this gap is to develop a general framework for reducing node-DP graph analytical tasks to edge-DP ones, enabling the reuse of existing edge-DP mechanisms. A straightforward solution based on group privacy divides the privacy budget by a given degree upper bound, but this leads to poor utility when the bound is set conservatively large to accommodate worst-case inputs. To address this, we propose node-to-edge (N2E), a general framework that reduces any node-DP graph analytical task to an edge-DP one, with the error dependency on the graph's true maximum degree. N2E introduces two novel techniques: a distance-preserving clipping mechanism that bounds edge distance between neighboring graphs after clipping, and the first node-DP mechanism for maximum degree approximation, enabling tight, privacy-preserving clipping thresholds. By instantiating N2E with existing edge-DP mechanisms, we obtain the first node-DP solutions for tasks such as maximum degree estimation. For edge counting, our method theoretically matches the error of the state-of-the-art, which is provably optimal, and significantly outperforms existing approaches for degree distribution estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves up to a 2.5x reduction in error for edge counting and up to an 80x reduction for degree distribution estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}

Specifically, data deletion, a core component of machine unlearning, faces three critical challenges in learned CE models: attribute-level sensitivity, inter-table propagation and domain disappearance leading to severe overestimation in multi-way joins. We propose Cardinality Estimation Pruning (CEP), the first unlearning framework specifically designed for multi-table learned CE systems. CEP introduces Distribution Sensitivity Pruning, which constructs semi-join deletion results and computes sensitivity scores to guide parameter pruning, and Domain Pruning, which removes support for value domains entirely eliminated by deletion.

The aim is to allow rewrites to alter the structure and syntactic outcome of an original query while keeping the obtainable insights intact. This drastically differs from traditional query rewriting, which typically aims to decrease query evaluation time by using strict equivalence rules and optimization heuristics on the query plan. Rewriting queries to queries that only provide a similar insight but otherwise can be entirely different can remedy inaccessible original data tables due to access control, privacy, or expensive data access regarding monetary cost or remote access. In this paper, we put forward INQURE, a system designed for INtent-based QUery REwriting. It uses access to a large language model (LLM) for the query understanding and human-like derivation of alternate queries. Around the LLM, INQURE employs upfront table filtering and subsequent candidate rewrite pruning and ranking. We report on the results of an evaluation using a benchmark set of over 900 database table schemas and discuss the pros and cons of alternate approaches regarding runtime and quality of the rewrites of a user study.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}

This archived version has a full appendix", "summary": "Real-world AI/ML workflows often apply inference computations to feature vectors joined from multiple datasets. To avoid the redundant AI/ML computations caused by repeated data records in the join's output, factorized ML has been proposed to decompose ML computations into sub-computations to be executed on each normalized dataset. However, there is insufficient discussion on how factorized ML could impact AI/ML inference over multi-way joins. To address the limitations, we propose a novel declarative InferF system, focusing on the factorization of arbitrary inference workflows represented as analyzable expressions over the multi-way joins. We formalize our problem to flexibly push down partial factorized computations to qualified nodes in the join tree to minimize the overall inference computation and join costs and propose two algorithms to resolve the problem: (1) a greedy algorithm based on a per-node cost function that estimates the influence on overall latency if a subset of factorized computations is pushed to a node, and (2) a genetic algorithm for iteratively enumerating and evaluating promising factorization plans. We implement InferF on Velox, an open-sourced database engine from Meta, evaluate it on real-world datasets, observed up to 11.3x speedups, and systematically summarized the factors that determine when factorized ML can benefit AI/ML inference workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}

This paper presents AVS, an Autonomous Vehicle Storage system that co-designs computation with a hierarchical layout: modality-aware reduction and compression, hot-cold tiering with daily archival, and a lightweight metadata layer for indexing. The design is grounded with system-level benchmarks on AV data that cover SSD and HDD filesystems and embedded indexing, and is validated on embedded hardware with real L4 autonomous driving traces.

GED is determined by an optimal alignment between a pair of graphs that partitions each into aligned (zero-cost) and unaligned (cost-incurring) substructures. Due to NP-hard nature of exact GED computation, GED approximations based on Graph Neural Network(GNN) have emerged. Existing GNN-based GED approaches typically learn node embeddings for each graph and then aggregate pairwise node similarities to estimate the final similarity. Despite their effectiveness, we identify a mismatch between this prevalent node-centric matching paradigm and the core principles of GED. This discrepancy leads to two critical limitations: (1) a failure to capture the global structural correspondence for optimal alignment, and (2) a misattribution of edit costs driven by spurious node level signals. To address these limitations, we propose GCGSim, a GED-consistent graph similarity learning framework centering on graph-level matching and substructure-level edit costs. Specifically, we make three core technical contributions. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that GCGSim achieves state-of-the-art performance.

While cloud-native RDBMSs provide elastic computing resources via disaggregated computing and storage, storage costs remain a critical user concern. Consequently, data compression emerges as an effective strategy to reduce storage costs. However, existing compression approaches in RDBMSs present a stark trade-off: software-based approaches incur significant performance overheads, while hardware-based alternatives lack the flexibility required for diverse database workloads. In this paper, we present PolarStore, a compressed shared storage system for cloud-native RDBMSs. PolarStore employs a dual-layer compression mechanism that combines in-storage compression in PolarCSD hardware with lightweight compression in software. This design leverages the strengths of both approaches. PolarStore also incorporates database-oriented optimizations to maintain high performance on critical I/O paths. Drawing from large-scale deployment experiences, we also introduce hardware improvements for PolarCSD to ensure host-level stability and propose a compression-aware scheduling scheme to improve cluster-level space efficiency. PolarStore is currently deployed on thousands of storage servers within PolarDB, managing over 100 PB of data. It achieves a compression ratio of 3.55 and reduces storage costs by approximately 60%.
