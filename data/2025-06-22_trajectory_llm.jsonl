Many solutions rely on\ntrajectory generation and tracking, whereas in contrast, path-following control\nis a particularly promising approach, offering an intuitive and natural\napproach to automate tasks for drones and other vehicles. While different\nsolutions to the path-following problem have been proposed, most of them lack\nthe capability to explicitly handle state and input constraints, are formulated\nin a conservative two-stage approach, or are only applicable to linear systems.\nTo address these challenges, the paper is built upon a Model Predictive\nControl-based path-following framework and extends its application to the\nCrazyflie quadrotor, which is investigated in hardware experiments. A cascaded\ncontrol structure including an underlying attitude controller is included in\nthe Model Predictive Path-Following Control formulation to meet the challenging\nreal-time demands of quadrotor control. The effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod is demonstrated through real-world experiments, representing, to the\nbest of the authors' knowledge, a novel application of this MPC-based\npath-following approach to the quadrotor. Additionally, as an extension to the\noriginal method, to allow for deviations of the path in cases where the precise\nfollowing of the path might be overly restrictive, a corridor path-following\napproach is presented.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08MPC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6d89\u53ca\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u6d89\u53ca\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5173\u952e\u8bcd'path-following'\u548c'Model Predictive Control'\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "keywords": ["path-following", "Model Predictive Control", "trajectory generation"]}}
