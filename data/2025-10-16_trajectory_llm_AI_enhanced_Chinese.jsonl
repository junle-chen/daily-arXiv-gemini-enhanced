Existing solutions attempt to incorporate\nexplicit 3D sensor inputs such as depth maps or point clouds, but these\napproaches face challenges due to sensor noise, hardware heterogeneity, and\nincomplete depth coverage in existing datasets. Alternative methods that\nestimate 3D cues from 2D images also suffer from the limited performance of\ndepth estimators.We propose Spatial Forcing (SF), a simple yet effective\nalignment strategy that implicitly forces VLA models to develop spatial\ncomprehension capabilities without relying on explicit 3D inputs or depth\nestimators. SF aligns intermediate visual embeddings of VLAs with geometric\nrepresentations produced by pretrained 3D foundation models. By enforcing\nalignment at intermediate layers, SF guides VLAs to encode richer spatial\nrepresentations that enhance action precision.Extensive experiments in\nsimulation and real-world environments demonstrate that SF achieves\nstate-of-the-art results, surpassing both 2D- and 3D-based VLAs. SF further\naccelerates training by up to 3.8x and improves data efficiency across diverse\nrobotic tasks.

However, such memory editing actions break the\nstandard assumption of a continuously growing prefix in LLM interactions,\nleading to what we call trajectory fractures. These non-prefix changes disrupt\nthe causal continuity required by standard policy gradient methods, making\nthose methods inapplicable. To address this, we propose a new algorithm,\nDynamic Context Policy Optimization, which enables stable end-to-end\nreinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and\napplying trajectory-level advantages to the resulting action segments. Our\nresults demonstrate that jointly optimizing for task reasoning and memory\nmanagement in an end-to-end fashion not only reduces overall computational\nconsumption but also improves task performance, driven by adaptive context\ncuration strategies tailored to the model's intrinsic capabilities.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u7a0bagent\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ba1\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u6d89\u53ca\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u63d0\u5230\u4e86\u201ctrajectory fractures\u201d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u6027\u8d28\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002\u603b\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u66f4\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5173\u8054\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "keywords": ["Large Language Models", "LLM", "reinforcement learning", "agentic tasks", "trajectory fractures"]}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}
