To\naddress this inefficiency, we propose KeyWorld, a framework that improves\ntext-conditioned robotic world models by concentrating transformers computation\non a few semantic key frames while employing a lightweight convolutional model\nto fill the intermediate frames. Specifically, KeyWorld first identifies\nsignificant transitions by iteratively simplifying the robot's motion\ntrajectories, obtaining the ground truth key frames. Then, a DiT model is\ntrained to reason and generate these physically meaningful key frames from\ntextual task descriptions.
