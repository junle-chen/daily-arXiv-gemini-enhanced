Abstract: To meet the standards of the Open Science movement, the FAIR Principles emphasize the importance of making scientific data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. Yet, creating a repository that adheres to these principles presents significant challenges. Managing large volumes of diverse research data and metadata, often generated rapidly, requires a precise approach. This necessity has led to the development of Software Reference Architectures (SRAs) to guide the implementation process for FAIR-compliant repositories. This article conducts a systematic review of research efforts focused on architectural solutions for such repositories. We detail our methodology, covering all activities undertaken in the planning and execution phases of the review. We analyze 323 references from reputable sources and expert recommendations, identifying 7 studies on general-purpose big data SRAs, 13 pipelines implementing FAIR Principles in specific contexts, and 3 FAIR-compliant big data SRAs. We provide a thorough description of their key features and assess whether the research questions posed in the planning phase were adequately addressed. Additionally, we discuss the limitations of the retrieved studies and identify tendencies and opportunities for further research.

Abstract: Unstructured data, such as text, images, audio, and video, comprises the vast majority of the world's information, yet it remains poorly supported by traditional data systems that rely on structured formats for computation. We argue for a new paradigm, which we call computing on unstructured data, built around three stages: extraction of latent structure, transformation of this structure through data processing techniques, and projection back into unstructured formats. This bi-directional pipeline allows unstructured data to benefit from the analytical power of structured computation, while preserving the richness and accessibility of unstructured representations for human and AI consumption. We illustrate this paradigm through two use cases and present the research components that need to be developed in a new data system called MXFlow.

Abstract: Open data portals are essential for providing public access to open datasets. However, their search interfaces typically rely on keyword-based mechanisms and a narrow set of metadata fields. This design makes it difficult for users to find datasets using natural language queries. The problem is worsened by metadata that is often incomplete or inconsistent, especially when users lack familiarity with domain-specific terminology. In this paper, we examine how individual metadata fields affect the success of conversational dataset retrieval and whether LLMs can help bridge the gap between natural queries and structured metadata. We conduct a controlled ablation study using simulated natural language queries over real-world datasets to evaluate retrieval performance under various metadata configurations. We also compare existing content of the metadata field 'description' with LLM-generated content, exploring how different prompting strategies influence quality and impact on search outcomes. Our findings suggest that dataset descriptions play a central role in aligning with user intent, and that LLM-generated descriptions can support effective retrieval. These results highlight both the limitations of current metadata practices and the potential of generative models to improve dataset discoverability in open data portals.

Abstract: Causal fairness in databases is crucial to preventing biased and inaccurate outcomes in downstream tasks. While most prior work assumes a known causal model, recent efforts relax this assumption by enforcing additional constraints. However, these approaches often fail to capture broader attribute relationships that are critical to maintaining utility. This raises a fundamental question: Can we harness the benefits of causal reasoning to design efficient and effective fairness solutions without relying on strong assumptions about the underlying causal model? In this paper, we seek to answer this question by introducing CausalPre, a scalable and effective causality-guided data pre-processing framework that guarantees justifiable fairness, a strong causal notion of fairness. CausalPre extracts causally fair relationships by reformulating the originally complex and computationally infeasible extraction task into a tailored distribution estimation problem. To ensure scalability, CausalPre adopts a carefully crafted variant of low-dimensional marginal factorization to approximate the joint distribution, complemented by a heuristic algorithm that efficiently tackles the associated computational challenge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CausalPre is both effective and scalable, challenging the conventional belief that achieving causal fairness requires trading off relationship coverage for relaxed model assumptions.
