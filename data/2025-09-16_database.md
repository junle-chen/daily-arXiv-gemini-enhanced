Abstract: Given a conjunctive query and a database instance, we aim to develop an index that can efficiently answer spatial queries on the results of a conjunctive query. We are interested in some commonly used spatial queries, such as range emptiness, range count, and nearest neighbor queries. These queries have essential applications in data analytics, such as filtering relational data based on attribute ranges and temporal graph analysis for counting graph structures like stars, paths, and cliques. Furthermore, this line of research can accelerate relational algorithms that incorporate spatial queries in their workflow, such as relational clustering. Known approaches either have to spend $\tilde{O}(N)$ query time or use space as large as the number of query results, which are inefficient or unrealistic to employ in practice. Hence, we aim to construct an index that answers spatial conjunctive queries in both time- and space-efficient ways.   In this paper, we establish lower bounds on the tradeoff between answering time and space usage. For $k$-star (resp. $k$-path) queries, we show that any index for range emptiness, range counting or nearest neighbor queries with $T$ answering time requires $\Omega\left(N+\frac{N^k}{T^k}\right)$ (resp. $\Omega\left(N+\frac{N^2}{T^{2/(k-1)}}\right)$) space. Then, we construct optimal indexes for answering range emptiness and range counting problems over $k$-star and $k$-path queries. Extending this result, we build an index for hierarchical queries. By resorting to the generalized hypertree decomposition, we can extend our index to arbitrary conjunctive queries for supporting spatial conjunctive queries. Finally, we show how our new indexes can be used to improve the running time of known algorithms in the relational setting.

Abstract: We consider conjunctive queries with arithmetic comparisons (CQAC) and investigate the computational complexity of the problem: Given two CQAC queries, $Q$ and $Q'$, is $Q'$ contained in $Q$? We know that, for CQAC queries, the problem of testing containment is $\Pi_2 ^p$ -complete. However, there are broad classes of queries with semi-interval arithmetic comparisons in the containing query that render the problem solvable in NP. In all cases examined the contained query is allowed to be any CQAC. Interestingly, we also prove that there are simple cases where the problem remains $\Pi_2 ^p$ -complete.   We also investigate the complexity of computing certain answers in the framework of answering CQAC queries with semi-interval comparisons using any CQAC views. We prove that maximally contained rewritings in the language of union of CQACs always compute exactly all certain answers. We find cases where we can compute certain answers in polynomial time using maximally contained rewritings.

Abstract: Setchain has been proposed to increase blockchain scalability by relaxing the strict total order requirement among transactions. Setchain organizes elements into a sequence of sets, referred to as epochs, so that elements within each epoch are unordered. In this paper, we propose and evaluate three distinct Setchain algorithms, that leverage an underlying block-based ledger. Vanilla is a basic implementation that serves as a reference point. Compresschain aggregates elements into batches, and compresses these batches before appending them as epochs in the ledger. Hashchain converts batches into fixed-length hashes which are appended as epochs in the ledger. This requires Hashchain to use a distributed service to obtain the batch contents from its hash. To allow light clients to safely interact with only one server, the proposed algorithms maintain, as part of the Setchain, proofs for the epochs. An epoch-proof is the hash of the epoch, cryptographically signed by a server. A client can verify the correctness of an epoch with $f+1$ epoch-proofs (where $f$ is the maximum number of Byzantine servers assumed). All three Setchain algorithms are implemented on top of the CometBFT blockchain application platform. We conducted performance evaluations across various configurations, using clusters of four, seven, and ten servers. Our results show that the Setchain algorithms reach orders of magnitude higher throughput than the underlying blockchain, and achieve finality with latency below 4 seconds.

Abstract: This paper introduces text-2-SQL-4-PM, a bilingual (Portuguese-English) benchmark dataset designed for the text-to-SQL task in the process mining domain. Text-to-SQL conversion facilitates natural language querying of databases, increasing accessibility for users without SQL expertise and productivity for those that are experts. The text-2-SQL-4-PM dataset is customized to address the unique challenges of process mining, including specialized vocabularies and single-table relational structures derived from event logs. The dataset comprises 1,655 natural language utterances, including human-generated paraphrases, 205 SQL statements, and ten qualifiers. Methods include manual curation by experts, professional translations, and a detailed annotation process to enable nuanced analyses of task complexity. Additionally, a baseline study using GPT-3.5 Turbo demonstrates the feasibility and utility of the dataset for text-to-SQL applications. The results show that text-2-SQL-4-PM supports evaluation of text-to-SQL implementations, offering broader applicability for semantic parsing and other natural language processing tasks.

Abstract: Conventional vector-based memory systems rely on cosine or inner product similarity within real-valued embedding spaces. While computationally efficient, such approaches are inherently phase-insensitive and limited in their ability to capture resonance phenomena crucial for meaning representation. We propose Wave-Based Semantic Memory, a novel framework that models knowledge as wave patterns $\psi(x) = A(x) e^{i\phi(x)}$ and retrieves it through resonance-based interference. This approach preserves both amplitude and phase information, enabling more expressive and robust semantic similarity. We demonstrate that resonance-based retrieval achieves higher discriminative power in cases where vector methods fail, including phase shifts, negations, and compositional queries. Our implementation, ResonanceDB, shows scalability to millions of patterns with millisecond latency, positioning wave-based memory as a viable alternative to vector stores for AGI-oriented reasoning and knowledge representation.

Abstract: DBOS (DataBase Operating System) is a novel capability that integrates web services, operating system functions, and database features to significantly reduce web-deployment effort while increasing resilience. Integration of high performance network sensing enables DBOS web services to collaboratively create a shared awareness of their network environments to enhance their collective resilience and security. Network sensing is added to DBOS using GraphBLAS hypersparse traffic matrices via two approaches: (1) Python-GraphBLAS and (2) OneSparse PostgreSQL. These capabilities are demonstrated using the workflow and analytics from the IEEE/MIT/Amazon Anonymized Network Sensing Graph Challenge. The system was parallelized using pPython and benchmarked using 64 compute nodes on the MIT SuperCloud. The web request rate sustained by a single DBOS instance was ${>}10^5$, well above the required maximum, indicating that network sensing can be added to DBOS with negligible overhead. For collaborative awareness, many DBOS instances were connected to a single DBOS aggregator. The Python-GraphBLAS and OneSparse PostgreSQL implementations scaled linearly up to 64 and 32 nodes respectively. These results suggest that DBOS collaborative network awareness can be achieved with a negligible increase in computing resources.
