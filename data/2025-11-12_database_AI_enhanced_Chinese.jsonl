Ontology, as a structured, information-rich knowledge representation, can provide context, particularly in learning problems. This paper presents OntoTune, an ontology-based platform for enhancing learning for query optimization. By connecting SQL queries, database metadata, and statistics, the ontology developed in this research is promising in capturing relationships and important determinants of query performance. This research also develops a method to embed ontologies while preserving as much of the relationships and key information as possible, before feeding it into learning algorithms such as tree-based and graph-based convolutional networks.

We study this problem under online learning, where sellers face uncertain retrieval costs and buyers provide stochastic feedback to posted prices. Three main challenges arise: (1) heterogeneous and partial feedback in configuration learning, (2) variable and complex feedback in pricing learning, and (3) inherent coupling between configuration and pricing decisions.\n  We propose a hierarchical bandit framework that jointly optimizes retrieval configurations and pricing. Stage I employs contextual clustering with confidence-based exploration to learn effective configurations with logarithmic regret. Stage II adopts interval-based price selection with local Taylor approximation to estimate buyer responses and achieve sublinear regret. We establish theoretical guarantees with polynomial time complexity and validate the framework on four real-world datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements in cumulative reward and regret reduction compared with existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}

Code Available at https://github.com/t-satharasi/AI-Modal-Collapse-Code-for-Reproduction.git", "summary": "Artificial Intelligence, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), has transformed domains such as software engineering, journalism, creative writing, academia, and media (Naveed et al. 2025; arXiv:2307.06435). Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion generate high-quality images and videos from text. Evidence shows rapid expansion: 74.2% of newly published webpages now contain AI-generated material (Ryan Law 2025), 30-40% of the active web corpus is synthetic (Spennemann 2025; arXiv:2504.08755), 52% of U.S. adults use LLMs for writing, coding, or research (Staff 2025), and audits find AI involvement in 18% of financial complaints and 24% of press releases (Liang et al. 2025). The underlying neural architectures, including Transformers (Vaswani et al. 2023; arXiv:1706.03762), RNNs, LSTMs, GANs, and diffusion networks, depend on large, diverse, human-authored datasets (Shi & Iyengar 2019). As synthetic content dominates, recursive training risks eroding linguistic and semantic diversity, producing Model Collapse (Shumailov et al. 2024; arXiv:2307.15043; Dohmatob et al. 2024; arXiv:2402.07712). This study quantifies and forecasts collapse onset by examining year-wise semantic similarity in English-language Wikipedia (filtered Common Crawl) from 2013 to 2025 using Transformer embeddings and cosine similarity metrics. Results reveal a steady rise in similarity before public LLM adoption, likely driven by early RNN/LSTM translation and text-normalization pipelines, though modest due to a smaller scale. Observed fluctuations reflect irreducible linguistic diversity, variable corpus size across years, finite sampling error, and an exponential rise in similarity after the public adoption of LLM models. These findings provide a data-driven estimate of when recursive AI contamination may significantly threaten data richness and model generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}

This paper introduces AgriTrust, a federated semantic governance framework designed to resolve this paradox. AgriTrust integrates a multi-stakeholder governance model, built on pillars of Data Sovereignty, Transparent Data Contracts, Equitable Value Sharing, and Regulatory Compliance, with a semantic digital layer. This layer is realized through the AgriTrust Core Ontology, a formal OWL ontology that provides a shared vocabulary for tokenization, traceability, and certification, enabling true semantic interoperability across independent platforms. A key innovation is a blockchain-agnostic, multi-provider architecture that prevents vendor lock-in. The framework's viability is demonstrated through case studies across three critical Brazilian supply chains: coffee (for EUDR compliance), soy (for mass balance), and beef (for animal tracking). The results show that AgriTrust successfully enables verifiable provenance, automates compliance, and creates new revenue streams for data producers, thereby transforming data sharing from a trust-based dilemma into a governed, automated operation.

Each memory is a time-semantic-relational entity-a structure that simultaneously encodes when an event occurred, what it means, and how it connects to other events. Built initially atop PostgreSQL with pgvector extensions, MemoriesDB combines the properties of a time-series datastore, a vector database, and a graph system within a single append-only schema. Each memory is represented as a vertex uniquely labeled by its microsecond timestamp and accompanied by low- and high-dimensional normalized embeddings that capture semantic context. Directed edges between memories form labeled relations with per-edge metadata, enabling multiple contextual links between the same vertices. Together these constructs form a time-indexed stack of temporal-semantic surfaces, where edges project as directional arrows in a 1+1-dimensional similarity field, tracing the evolution of meaning through time while maintaining cross-temporal coherence. This formulation supports efficient time-bounded retrieval, hybrid semantic search, and lightweight structural reasoning in a single query path.
