To reflect the animal behavior generation procedure, we introduce\nskill-based imitation learning (SKIL) for behavior understanding, a\nreinforcement learning-based imitation framework that (1) infers interpretable\nskill sets, i.e., latent basis functions of behavior, by leveraging\nrepresentation learning on transition probabilities, and (2) parameterizes\npolicies as dynamic mixtures of these skills. We validate our approach on a\nsimple grid world, a discrete labyrinth, and unconstrained videos of freely\nmoving animals. Across tasks, it identifies reusable skill components, learns\ncontinuously evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic\ntrajectories beyond the capabilities of traditional discrete models. By\nexploiting generative behavior modeling with compositional representations, our\nmethod offers a concise, principled account of how complex animal behaviors\nemerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "This paper focuses on learning motor primitives and generating realistic trajectories of animal behaviors using reinforcement learning. While it doesn't directly involve Large Language Models, the generation of trajectories and the learning of skills can be considered related to trajectory prediction. The use of representation learning also suggests a connection to modern machine learning techniques often used in conjunction with large models, albeit indirectly.", "keywords": ["trajectory prediction", "imitation learning", "representation learning", "motor primitives", "skill learning"]}}

Although\nmembership inference attacks and hidden canaries have been explored to trace\ndata usage, such methods rely on memorization of training data, which LM\nproviders try to limit. In this work, we demonstrate that indirect data\npoisoning (where the targeted behavior is absent from training data) is not\nonly feasible but also allow to effectively protect a dataset and trace its\nuse. Using gradient-based optimization prompt-tuning, we make a model learn\narbitrary secret sequences: secret responses to secret prompts that are absent\nfrom the training corpus. We validate our approach on language models\npre-trained from scratch and show that less than 0.005% of poisoned tokens are\nsufficient to covertly make a LM learn a secret and detect it with extremely\nhigh confidence ($p < 10^{-55}$) with a theoretically certifiable scheme.\nCrucially, this occurs without performance degradation (on LM benchmarks) and\ndespite secrets never appearing in the training set.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "This paper focuses on backdooring large language models (LLMs) during pre-training using data poisoning techniques.
