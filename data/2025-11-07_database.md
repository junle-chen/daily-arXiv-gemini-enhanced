Abstract: Traditional ETL and ELT design patterns struggle to meet modern requirements of scalability, governance, and real-time data processing. Hybrid approaches such as ETLT (Extract-Transform-Load-Transform) and ELTL (Extract-Load-Transform-Load) are already used in practice, but the literature lacks best practices and formal recognition of these approaches as design patterns. This paper formalizes ETLT and ELTL as reusable design patterns by codifying implicit best practices and introduces enhanced variants, ETLT++ and ELTL++, to address persistent gaps in governance, quality assurance, and observability. We define ETLT and ELTL patterns systematically within a design pattern framework, outlining their structure, trade-offs, and use cases. Building on this foundation, we extend them into ETLT++ and ELTL++ by embedding explicit contracts, versioning, semantic curation, and continuous monitoring as mandatory design obligations. The proposed framework offers practitioners a structured roadmap to build auditable, scalable, and cost-efficient pipelines, unifying quality enforcement, lineage, and usability across multi-cloud and real-time contexts. By formalizing ETLT and ELTL, and enhancing them through ETLT++ and ELTL++, this work bridges the gap between ad hoc practice and systematic design, providing a reusable foundation for modern, trustworthy data engineering.

Abstract: Database (DB) search and clustering are fundamental in proteomics but conventional full clustering and search approaches demand high resources and incur long latency. We propose a lightweight incremental clustering and highly parallelizable DB search platform tailored for resource-constrained environments, delivering low energy and latency without compromising performance. By leveraging mass-spectrometry insights, we employ bucket-wise parallelization and query scheduling to reduce latency. A one-time hardware initialization with pre-clustered proteomics data enables continuous DB search and local re-clustering, offering a more practical and efficient alternative to clustering from scratch. Heuristics from pre-clustered data guide incremental clustering, accelerating the process by 20x with only a 0.3% increase in clustering error. DB search results overlap by 96% with state-of-the-art tools, validating search quality. The hardware leverages a 3T 2M T J SOT-CAM at the 7nm node with a compute-in-memory design. For the human genome draft dataset (131GB), setup requires 1.19mJ for 2M spectra, while a 1000 query search consumes 1.1{\mu}J. Bucket-wise parallelization further achieves 100x speedup.

Abstract: Data provenance has numerous applications in the context of data preparation pipelines. It can be used for debugging faulty pipelines, interpreting results, verifying fairness, and identifying data quality issues, which may affect the sources feeding the pipeline execution. In this paper, we present an indexing mechanism to efficiently capture and query pipeline provenance. Our solution leverages tensors to capture fine-grained provenance of data processing operations, using minimal memory. In addition to record-level lineage relationships, we provide finer granularity at the attribute level. This is achieved by augmenting tensors, which capture retrospective provenance, with prospective provenance information, drawing connections between input and output schemas of data processing operations. We demonstrate how these two types of provenance (retrospective and prospective) can be combined to answer a broad range of provenance queries efficiently, and show effectiveness through evaluation exercises using both real and synthetic data.

Abstract: Unstructured data, in the form of text, images, video, and audio, is produced at exponentially higher rates. In tandem, machine learning (ML) methods have become increasingly powerful at analyzing unstructured data. Modern ML methods can now detect objects in images, understand actions in videos, and even classify complex legal texts based on legal intent. Combined, these trends make it increasingly feasible for analysts and researchers to automatically understand the "real world." However, there are major challenges in deploying these techniques: 1) executing queries efficiently given the expense of ML methods, 2) expressing queries over bespoke forms of data, and 3) handling errors in ML methods.   In this monograph, we discuss challenges and advances in data management systems for unstructured data using ML, with a particular focus on video analytics. Using ML to answer queries introduces new challenges.First, even turning user intent into queries can be challenging: it is not obvious how to express a query of the form "select instances of cars turning left." Second, ML models can be orders of magnitude more expensive compared to processing traditional structured data. Third, ML models and the methods to accelerate analytics with ML models can be error-prone.   Recent work in the data management community has aimed to address all of these challenges. Users can now express queries via user-defined functions, opaquely through standard structured schemas, and even by providing examples. Given a query, recent work focuses on optimizing queries by approximating expensive "gold" methods with varying levels of guarantees. Finally, to handle errors in ML models, recent work has focused on applying outlier and drift detection to data analytics with ML.
