Current approaches are limited to\nstatic image features, and available datasets often lack temporal annotations,\nignoring the dynamics critical for accurate procedural interpretation. We\npropose SurgViVQA, a surgical VideoQA model that extends visual reasoning from\nstatic images to dynamic surgical scenes. It uses a Masked Video--Text Encoder\nto fuse video and question features, capturing temporal cues such as motion and\ntool--tissue interactions, which a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) then\ndecodes into coherent answers. To evaluate its performance, we curated\nREAL-Colon-VQA, a colonoscopic video dataset that includes motion-related\nquestions and diagnostic attributes, as well as out-of-template questions with\nrephrased or semantically altered formulations to assess model robustness.\nExperimental validation on REAL-Colon-VQA and the public EndoVis18-VQA dataset\nshows that SurgViVQA outperforms existing image-based VQA benchmark models,\nparticularly in keyword accuracy, improving over PitVQA by +11\\% on\nREAL-Colon-VQA and +9\\% on EndoVis18-VQA. A perturbation study on the questions\nfurther confirms improved generalizability and robustness to variations in\nquestion phrasing. SurgViVQA and the REAL-Colon-VQA dataset provide a framework\nfor temporally-aware understanding in surgical VideoQA, enabling AI models to\ninterpret dynamic procedural contexts more effectively.

However,\nexisting methods based on saliency produce entangled explanations, making it\nunclear whether predictions rely on motion or spatial context. Language-based\napproaches offer structure but often fail to explain motions due to their tacit\nnature -- intuitively understood but difficult to verbalize. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Disentangled Action aNd Context concept-based\nExplainable (DANCE) video action recognition, a framework that predicts actions\nthrough disentangled concept types: motion dynamics, objects, and scenes. We\ndefine motion dynamics concepts as human pose sequences. We employ a large\nlanguage model to automatically extract object and scene concepts. Built on an\nante-hoc concept bottleneck design, DANCE enforces prediction through these\nconcepts. Experiments on four datasets -- KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, and UCF-101\n-- demonstrate that DANCE significantly improves explanation clarity with\ncompetitive performance. We validate the superior interpretability of DANCE\nthrough a user study. Experimental results also show that DANCE is beneficial\nfor model debugging, editing, and failure analysis.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "This paper focuses on video action recognition and uses a large language model to extract object and scene concepts.
