The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use\ncheckpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an\nadditional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield\nsignificant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases\nand scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose,\nCheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by\na weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state\nof the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However,\nbecause of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover\nfailures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+\nwith out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last\nstages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is\nmimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by\nsimply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover\nthe (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring\nstages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively\nevaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with\nvarying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates\n(5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant\ncomputation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%.
