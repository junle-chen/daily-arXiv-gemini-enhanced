Existing top-k diversified methods typically focus on maximizing vertex coverage, but often return results in the same region, limiting topological diversity. We propose the Distance-Diversified Top-k Subgraph Matching (DTkSM) problem, which selects k isomorphic matches with maximal pairwise topological distances to better capture global graph structure. To address its computational challenges, we introduce the Partition-based Distance Diversity (PDD) framework, which partitions the graph and retrieves diverse matches from distant regions. To enhance efficiency, we develop two optimizations: embedding-driven partition filtering and densest-based partition selection over a Partition Adjacency Graph.

Per-record Differential Privacy (PrDP) addresses this by defining the privacy budget as a function of each record, offering better alignment with real-world needs. However, the dependency between the privacy budget and the data value introduces challenges in protecting the budget's privacy itself. Existing solutions either handle specific privacy functions or adopt relaxed PrDP definitions. A simple workaround is to use the global minimum of the privacy function, but this severely degrades utility, as the minimum is often set extremely low to account for rare records with high privacy needs. In this work, we propose a general and practical framework that enables any standard DP mechanism to support PrDP, with error depending only on the minimal privacy requirement among records actually present in the dataset. Since directly revealing this minimum may leak information, we introduce a core technique called privacy-specified domain partitioning, which ensures accurate estimation without compromising privacy. We also extend our framework to the local DP setting via a novel technique, privacy-specified query augmentation. Using our framework, we present the first PrDP solutions for fundamental tasks such as count, sum, and maximum estimation.

However, deploying these models for EHR question answering (QA) systems in safety-critical clinical environments remains challenging: incorrect SQL queries-whether caused by model errors or problematic user inputs-can undermine clinical decision-making and jeopardize patient care. While prior work has mainly focused on improving SQL generation accuracy or filtering questions before execution, there is a lack of a unified benchmark for evaluating independent post-hoc verification mechanisms (i.e., a component that inspects and validates the generated SQL before execution), which is crucial for safe deployment. To fill this gap, we introduce SCARE, a benchmark for evaluating methods that function as a post-hoc safety layer in EHR QA systems. SCARE evaluates the joint task of (1) classifying question answerability (i.e., determining whether a question is answerable, ambiguous, or unanswerable) and (2) verifying or correcting candidate SQL queries. The benchmark comprises 4,200 triples of questions, candidate SQL queries, and expected model outputs, grounded in the MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU databases. It covers a diverse set of questions and corresponding candidate SQL queries generated by seven different text-to-SQL models, ensuring a realistic and challenging evaluation. Using SCARE, we benchmark a range of approaches-from two-stage methods to agentic frameworks.

These properties are a natural fit for SQL database workloads dominated by predicate evaluation and scans, which demand low energy and low latency over large fact tables. Notably, HDC's noise-tolerance maps well onto emerging ferroelectric NAND (FeNAND) memories, which provide ultra-high density and in-storage compute capability but suffer from elevated raw bit-error rates. In this work, we propose HDDB, a hardware-software co-design that combines HDC with FeNAND multi-level cells (MLC) to perform in-storage SQL predicate evaluation and analytics with massive parallelism and minimal data movement. Particularly, we introduce novel HDC encoding techniques for standard SQL data tables and formulate predicate-based filtering and aggregation as highly efficient HDC operations that can happen in-storage. By exploiting the intrinsic redundancy of HDC, HDDB maintains correct predicate and decode outcomes under substantial device noise (up to 10% randomly corrupted TLC cells) without explicit error-correction overheads.

PCR restricts the search space to nodes reachable from an anchor node, preventing retrieval of structurally disconnected information that may lead to inconsistent reasoning. We evaluate PCR on PathRAG-6, a benchmark spanning six domains with 180 nodes and 360 edges. Our results show that PCR achieves full structural consistency compared to 24-32 percent in baseline methods, while maintaining strong relevance scores. On the technology domain, PCR obtains full relevance at rank 10 with full structural consistency, significantly outperforming vector search and hybrid retrieval.
