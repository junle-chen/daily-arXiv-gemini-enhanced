However, many entries lack complete metadata such as addresses or\ncategories, and some correspond to non-existent or fictional locations. In\ncontrast, OpenStreetMap (OSM) offers a rich, user-contributed POI dataset with\ndetailed and frequently updated metadata, though it does not formally verify\nwhether a POI represents an actual business. In this data paper, we present a\nmethodology that integrates the strengths of both datasets: Foursquare as a\ncomprehensive baseline of commercial POIs and OSM as a source of enriched\nmetadata. The combined dataset totals approximately 1 TB. While this full\nversion is not publicly released, we provide filtered releases with adjustable\nthresholds that reduce storage needs and make the data practical to download\nand use across domains. We also provide step-by-step instructions to reproduce\nthe full 631 GB build. Record linkage is achieved by computing name similarity\nscores and spatial distances between Foursquare and OSM POIs. These measures\nidentify and retain high-confidence matches that correspond to real businesses\nin Foursquare, have representations in OSM, and show strong name similarity.\nFinally, we use this filtered dataset to construct a graph-based representation\nof POIs enriched with attributes from both sources, enabling advanced spatial\nanalyses and a range of downstream applications."}

We present SurVigilance,\nan open-source tool that streamlines the process of retrieving safety data from\nseven major pharmacovigilance databases. SurVigilance provides a graphical user\ninterface as well as functions for programmatic access, thus enabling\nintegration into existing research workflows. SurVigilance utilizes a modular\narchitecture to provide access to the heterogeneous sources. By reducing the\ntechnical barriers to accessing safety data, SurVigilance aims to facilitate\npharmacovigilance research."}

Naser Lessani", "Guido Cervone"], "title": "From Questions to Queries: An AI-powered Multi-Agent Framework for Spatial Text-to-SQL", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.DB", "cs.IR"], "comment": null, "summary": "The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature\nof geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to\nnon-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs)\noffer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),\nsingle-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic\ncomplexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent\nframework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into\nspatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,\nincluding a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic\nenrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent\npipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity\nextraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a\nreview agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the\ngenerated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system\nusing both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive\nSpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and\nthree levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall\naccuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review\nand corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy\nof 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review\nagent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system\ngenerates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than\nthose in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and\nprovides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems,\nadvancing the development of autonomous GIS."}
