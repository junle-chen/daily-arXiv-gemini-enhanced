Existing frameworks often tie\nagents to specific query language dialects or obscure their reasoning; QueryGym\ninstead requires agents to construct explicit sequences of relational algebra\noperations, ensuring engine-agnostic evaluation and transparent step-by-step\nplanning. The environment is implemented as a Gymnasium interface that supplies\nobservations -- including schema details, intermediate results, and execution\nfeedback -- and receives actions that represent database exploration (e.g.,\npreviewing tables, sampling column values, retrieving unique values) as well as\nrelational algebra operations (e.g., filter, project, join). We detail the\nmotivation and the design of the environment. In the demo, we showcase the\nutility of the environment by contrasting it with contemporary LLMs that query\ndatabases. QueryGym serves as a practical testbed for research in error\nremediation, transparency, and reinforcement learning for query generation. For\nthe associated demo, see https://ibm.biz/QueryGym."}

It is, however, evident that this step\ncan cause significant bias in data and amplify unfairness in downstream tasks.\n  In this paper, we address this issue by introducing the unbiased binning\nproblem that, given an attribute to bucketize, finds its closest discretization\nto equal-size binning that satisfies group parity across different buckets.\nDefining a small set of boundary candidates, we prove that unbiased binning\nmust select its boundaries from this set. We then develop an efficient dynamic\nprogramming algorithm on top of the boundary candidates to solve the unbiased\nbinning problem.\n  Finding an unbiased binning may sometimes result in a high price of fairness,\nor it may not even exist, especially when group values follow different\ndistributions. Considering that a small bias in the group ratios may be\ntolerable in such settings, we introduce the epsilon-biased binning problem\nthat bounds the group disparities across buckets to a small value epsilon. We\nfirst develop a dynamic programming solution, DP, that finds the optimal\nbinning in quadratic time. The DP algorithm, while polynomial, does not scale\nto very large settings. Therefore, we propose a practically scalable algorithm,\nbased on local search (LS), for epsilon-biased binning. The key component of\nthe LS algorithm is a divide-and-conquer (D&C) algorithm that finds a\nnear-optimal solution for the problem in near-linear time. We prove that D&C\nfinds a valid solution for the problem unless none exists. The LS algorithm\nthen initiates a local search, using the D&C solution as the upper bound, to\nfind the optimal solution."}

A detailed logical database model is proposed, designed for\ncomprehensive analysis that combines financial sales metrics with behavioral\npatterns of customer movement. The article also analyzes the expected business\nbenefits of RFID implementation through the lens of the Balanced Scorecard\n(BSC), which evaluates financial performance, customer satisfaction, and\ninternal process optimization. It is concluded that the integration of tracking\nand transactional data creates a foundation for transforming retail into a\nprecise, data-driven science, providing unprecedented visibility into physical\nproduct flows and consumer behavior."}

To do so and ensure privacy, a natural way consists in\nusing a decentralized architecture and Federated Learning algorithms. This\nensures that data stays in the organization in which it has been collected, but\nrequires data to be collected in similar settings and similar models. In\npractice, this is often not the case because healthcare institutions work\nindividually with different representations and raw data; they do not have\nmeans to normalize their data, and even less to do so across centers. For\ninstance, clinicians have at hand phenotypic, clinical, imaging and genomic\ndata (each individually collected) and want to better understand some diseases\nby analyzing them together. This example highlights the needs and challenges\nfor a cooperative use of this wealth of information. We designed and\nimplemented a framework, named I-ETL, for integrating highly heterogeneous\nhealthcare datasets of hospitals in interoperable databases. Our proposal is\ntwofold: (i) we devise two general and extensible conceptual models for\nmodeling both data and metadata and (ii) we propose an Extract-Transform-Load\n(ETL) pipeline ensuring and assessing interoperability from the start. By\nconducting experiments on open-source datasets, we show that I-ETL succeeds in\nrepresenting various health datasets in a unified way thanks to our two general\nconceptual models. Next, we demonstrate the importance of blending\ninteroperability as a first-class citizen in integration pipelines, ensuring\npossible collaboration between different centers."}

In many of these problems, the reward\nfunction is verifiable, a setting termed RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We\napply RLVR to a popular data science benchmark called BIRD that measures the\nability of an AI agent to convert a natural language query for a database to\nSQL executions. We apply a simple and general-purpose training recipe involving\ncareful prompt and model selection, a warm-up stage using our offline RL\napproach called TAO, followed by rigorous online RLVR training. With no\nadditional training data beyond the BIRD training set and no use of proprietary\nmodels, our very first submission to the BIRD leaderboard reached\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on the private test set: 73.56% without\nself-consistency and 75.68% with self-consistency. In the latter case, our\nmodel also required fewer generations than the second-best approach. While BIRD\nis only a proxy task, the simplicity of our framework makes it broadly\napplicable to enterprise domains such as business intelligence, data science,\nand coding."}
