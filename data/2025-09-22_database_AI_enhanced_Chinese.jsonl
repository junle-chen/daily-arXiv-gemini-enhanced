In this paper, we examine how\nindividual metadata fields affect the success of conversational dataset\nretrieval and whether LLMs can help bridge the gap between natural queries and\nstructured metadata. We conduct a controlled ablation study using simulated\nnatural language queries over real-world datasets to evaluate retrieval\nperformance under various metadata configurations.

CausalPre extracts causally fair\nrelationships by reformulating the originally complex and computationally\ninfeasible extraction task into a tailored distribution estimation problem. To\nensure scalability, CausalPre adopts a carefully crafted variant of\nlow-dimensional marginal factorization to approximate the joint distribution,\ncomplemented by a heuristic algorithm that efficiently tackles the associated\ncomputational challenge.
