We propose a deep\nlearning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the\nunderlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method\nleverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently\nusing a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A\nneural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a\nmodel-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture\nprovides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the\nblur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of\nsharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine\nresults, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving\nconsistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive\nexperiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both\nsynthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially\nvariant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.\n  Code and trained models are available at\nhttps://github.com/GuillermoCarbajal/Blur2Seq/", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "The paper focuses on camera trajectory estimation from a single motion-blurred image.
