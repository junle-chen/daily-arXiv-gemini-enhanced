Recent advances in\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling alternative. With their strong\nreasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can adapt to new tasks through\nIn-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task adaptation through natural\nlanguage prompts and example-based guidance without retraining.

We\npresent D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop\ninteractions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics\nembodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT\nfor Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a\ncomplete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in\nembodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit\nthat unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x\ncompression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot\ngeneralization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction,\nenabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers\ndesktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation.\nUsing 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of\npseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO\nmanipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks.

In this paper,\nwe propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion\npriors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding.\nFlow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial\nlevels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO)\nadaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow\npriors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to\nfilter out highly irrelevant scene information.

In this work,\nwe bridge this gap by proposing NorMuon (Neuron-wise Normalized Muon), an\noptimizer that synergistically combines orthogonalization with neuron-level\nadaptive learning rates.

To enable practical deployment at scale, we\ndevelop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that\nstrategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices.\nExperiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently\noutperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency\nthan Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1 B pretraining setting, while\nmaintaining a comparable memory footprint to Muon.
