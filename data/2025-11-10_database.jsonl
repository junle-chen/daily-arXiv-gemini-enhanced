Compressing\nthese data while preserving their absolute fidelity is critical, and leveraging\nthe massive parallelism of modern GPUs offers a path to unprecedented\nthroughput. Nevertheless, designing such a high-performance GPU-based lossless\ncompressor faces three key challenges: 1) heterogeneous data movement\nbottlenecks, 2) precision-preserving conversion complexity, and 3)\nanomaly-induced sparsity degradation. To address these challenges, this paper\nproposes Falcon, a GPU-based Floating-point Adaptive Lossless COmpressioN\nframework. Specifically, Falcon first introduces a lightweight asynchronous\npipeline, which hides the I/O latency during the data transmission between the\nCPU and GPU. Then, we propose an accurate and fast float-to-integer\ntransformation method with theoretical guarantees, which eliminates the errors\ncaused by floating-point arithmetic. Moreover, we devise an adaptive sparse\nbit-plane lossless encoding strategy, which reduces the sparsity caused by\noutliers. Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets show that our\ncompression ratio improves by 9.1% over the most advanced CPU-based method,\nwith compression throughput 2.43X higher and decompression throughput 2.4X\nhigher than the fastest GPU-based competitors, respectively."}

However, GD\nalgorithms face scalability challenges for high-dimensional data. For example,\nthe GreedyGD algorithm relies on an iterative bit-selection process across\n$d$-dimensional data resulting in $O(nd^2)$ complexity for $n$ data rows to\nselect bits to be used as bases and deviations. Although the $n$ data rows can\nbe reduced during training at the expense of performance, highly dimensional\ndata still experiences a marked loss in performance. This paper introduces\nEntroGD, an entropy-guided GD framework that reduces complexity of the\nbit-selection algorithm to $O(nd)$. EntroGD operates considers a two-step\nprocess. First, it generates condensed samples to preserve analytic fidelity.\nSecond, it applies entropy-guided bit selection to maximize compression\nefficiency. Across 18 datasets of varying types and dimensionalities, EntroGD\nachieves compression performance comparable to GD-based and universal\ncompressors, while reducing configuration time by up to 53.5$\\times$ over\nGreedyGD and accelerating clustering by up to 31.6$\\times$ over the original\ndata with negligible accuracy loss by performing analytics on the condensed\nsamples, which are much fewer than original samples. Thus, EntroGD provides an\nefficient and scalable solution to performing analytics directly on compressed\ndata."}

To prevent the former\nthreat, we propose a transaction-based framework to design very complex\nmulti-agent systems (VCMAS). To address the second threat, we offer to\nintegrate transaction scheduling into the proposed framework. We implemented\nboth of these ideas to develop the OptiMA framework and show that it is able to\nfacilitate the execution of VCMAS with more than a hundred agents.

This paper introduces\nClass-Based Image Composition, an approach that allows us to reformulate\ntraining inputs through a fusion of multiple images of the same class into\ncombined visual composites, named Composite Input Images (CoImg). That enhances\nthe intra-class variance and improves the valuable information density per\ntraining sample and increases the ability of the model to distinguish between\nsubtle disease patterns. Our method was evaluated on the Optical Coherence\nTomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods (OCTDL) (Kulyabin et\nal., 2024), which contains 2,064 high-resolution optical coherence tomography\n(OCT) scans of the human retina, representing seven distinct diseases with a\nsignificant class imbalance. We constructed a perfectly class-balanced version\nof this dataset, named Co-OCTDL, where each scan is resented as a 3x1 layout\ncomposite image. To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we\nconducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant\nusing a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical\nmodel architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed\napproach markedly improved diagnostic results.The enhanced Dataset achieved\nnear-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared\nto a baseline model trained on raw dataset.

It enforces that a specified set of\ndiscrete labels $S$ for the query must be included in the labels of each\nretrieved vector. Existing graph-based methods typically incorporate filter\nawareness by assigning fixed penalties or prioritizing nodes based on filter\nsatisfaction. However, since these methods use fixed, data in- dependent\npenalties, they often fail to generalize across datasets with diverse label and\nvector distributions. In this work, we propose a principled alternative that\nlearns the optimal trade-off between vector distance and filter match directly\nfrom the data, rather than relying on fixed penalties. We formulate this as a\nconstrained linear optimization problem, deriving weights that better reflect\nthe underlying filter distribution and more effectively address the filtered\nANN search problem. These learned weights guide both the search process and\nindex construction, leading to graph structures that more effectively capture\nthe underlying filter distribution and filter semantics. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that adapting the distance function to the data significantly im-\nproves accuracy by 5-10% over fixed-penalty methods, providing a more flexible\nand generalizable framework for the filtered ANN search problem."}

In this work, we explore three multi-agent\nLLM pipelines, with systematic performance benchmarking across a range of small\nto large open-source models: (1) Multi-agent discussion pipeline, where agents\niteratively critique and refine SQL queries, and a judge synthesizes the final\nanswer; (2) Planner-Coder pipeline, where a thinking model planner generates\nstepwise SQL generation plans and a coder synthesizes queries; and (3)\nCoder-Aggregator pipeline, where multiple coders independently generate SQL\nqueries, and a reasoning agent selects the best query.

In practice, these lanes rediscover the same candidates, so extra\ncompute does not increase coverage. We present a coordination-free lane\npartitioner that turns duplication into complementary work at the same cost and\ndeadline. For each query we (1) build a deterministic candidate pool sized to\nthe total top-k budget, (2) apply a per-query pseudorandom permutation, and (3)\nassign each lane a disjoint slice of positions. Lanes then return different\nresults by construction, with no runtime coordination.\n  At equal cost with four lanes (total candidate budget 64), on SIFT1M (1M SIFT\nfeature vectors) with Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs (HNSW)\nrecall@10 rises from 0.249 to 0.999 while lane overlap falls from nearly 100%\nto 0%. On MS MARCO (8.8M passages) with HNSW, hit@10 improves from 0.200 to\n0.601 and Mean Reciprocal Rank at 10 (MRR@10) from 0.133 to 0.330. For inverted\nfile (IVF) indexes we see smaller but consistent gains (for example, +11% on MS\nMARCO) by de-duplicating list routing. A microbenchmark shows planner overhead\nof ~37 microseconds per query (mean at the main setting) with linear growth in\nthe number of merged candidates.\n  These results yield a simple operational guideline: size the per-query pool\nto the total budget, deterministically partition positions across lanes, and\nturn redundant fan-out into complementary coverage without changing budget or\ndeadline."}
