Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize emergency services by enabling faster, safer, and more efficient responses. This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining. By reviewing the state of the art in AV intelligence, DM-augmented RL, and LLM-assisted ICL, this paper provides a critical framework for understanding the next generation of autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective.

Abstract: We introduce Lumine, the first open recipe for developing generalist agents capable of completing hours-long complex missions in real time within challenging 3D open-world environments. Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in high-stakes domains such as energy, healthcare, and climate. Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/SkyeGT/AlphaCast_Official .

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs), with their strong capabilities in environmental perception and generalizable driving decisions, are attracting growing attention from both academia and industry. However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.   To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization.However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Accident anticipation is essential for proactive and safe autonomous driving, where even a brief advance warning can enable critical evasive actions. However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.

Abstract: A world model enables an intelligent agent to imagine, predict, and reason about how the world evolves in response to its actions, and accordingly to plan and strategize. While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.

Abstract: Multi-drone surveillance systems offer enhanced coverage and robustness for pedestrian tracking, yet existing approaches struggle with dynamic camera positions and complex occlusions. This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\sim$90\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\sim$80\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur. The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems.

Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation can create realistic videos, yet existing image- and text-based conditioning fails to offer precise motion control. Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

Abstract: We present TransactionGPT (TGPT), a foundation model for consumer transaction data within one of world's largest payment networks. TGPT is designed to understand and generate transaction trajectories while simultaneously supporting a variety of downstream prediction and classification tasks. We introduce a novel 3D-Transformer architecture specifically tailored for capturing the complex dynamics in payment transaction data. This architecture incorporates design innovations that enhance modality fusion and computational efficiency, while seamlessly enabling joint optimization with downstream objectives. Trained on billion-scale real-world transactions, TGPT significantly improves downstream classification performance against a competitive production model and exhibits advantages over baselines in generating future transactions. We conduct extensive empirical evaluations utilizing a diverse collection of company transaction datasets spanning multiple downstream tasks, thereby enabling a thorough assessment of TGPT's effectiveness and efficiency in comparison to established methodologies. Furthermore, we examine the incorporation of LLM-derived embeddings within TGPT and benchmark its performance against fine-tuned LLMs, demonstrating that TGPT achieves superior predictive accuracy as well as faster training and inference. We anticipate that the architectural innovations and practical guidelines from this work will advance foundation models for transaction-like data and catalyze future research in this emerging field.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive data fusion and reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving (AD). However, training LLMs for AD faces significant challenges including high computation transmission costs, and privacy concerns associated with sensitive driving data. Federated Learning (FL) is promising for enabling autonomous vehicles (AVs) to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. We present Federated LLM-based Autonomous Driving (FLAD), an FL framework that leverages distributed multimodal sensory data across AVs in heterogeneous environment. FLAD has three key innovations: (1) a cloud-edge-vehicle collaborative architecture that reduces communication delay and preserving data privacy; (2) an intelligent parallelized collaborative training with a communication scheduling mechanism that optimizes training efficiency, leveraging end-devices otherwise having insufficient resources for model training; and (3) a knowledge distillation method that personalizes LLM according to heterogeneous edge data. In addition, we prototype FLAD in a testbed with NVIDIA Jetsons, overcoming practical implementation challenges including CPU/GPU memory sharing in resource-constrained devices, dynamic model partitions, and fault-tolerant training.Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that FLAD achieves superior end-to-end AD performance while efficiently utilizing distributed vehicular resources, opening up new possibilities for future collaborative AD model training and knowledge sharing.

Abstract: Practitioners deploying time series forecasting models face a dilemma: exhaustively validating dozens of models is computationally prohibitive, yet choosing the wrong model risks poor performance. We show that spectral predictability~$Ω$ -- a simple signal processing metric -- systematically stratifies model family performance, enabling fast model selection. We conduct controlled experiments in four different domains, then further expand our analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from the GIFT-Eval benchmark. We find that large time series foundation models (TSFMs) systematically outperform lightweight task-trained baselines when $Ω$ is high, while their advantage vanishes as $Ω$ drops. Computing $Ω$ takes seconds per dataset, enabling practitioners to quickly assess whether their data suits TSFM approaches or whether simpler, cheaper models suffice. We demonstrate that $Ω$ stratifies model performance predictably, offering a practical first-pass filter that reduces validation costs while highlighting the need for models that excel on genuinely difficult (low-$Ω$) problems rather than merely optimizing easy ones.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting on transportation networks is a complex task that requires understanding how traffic nodes interact within a dynamic, evolving system dictated by traffic flow dynamics and social behavioral patterns. The importance of transportation networks and ITS for modern mobility and commerce necessitates forecasting models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, efficient, and robust under structural or temporal perturbations. Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability. In this work, we introduce Weaver, a novel attention-based model that applies Kronecker product approximations (KPA) to decompose the PN X PN spatiotemporal attention of O(P^2N^2) complexity into local P X P temporal and N X N spatial attention maps. This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability. To fully utilize the model's learning capacity, we introduce the Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning. Evaluations on PEMS-BAY and METR-LA show that Weaver achieves competitive performance across model categories while training more efficiently.

Abstract: In mobile robot shared control, effectively understanding human motion intention is critical for seamless human-robot collaboration. This paper presents a novel shared control framework featuring planning-level intention prediction. A path replanning algorithm is designed to adjust the robot's desired trajectory according to inferred human intentions. To represent future motion intentions, we introduce the concept of an intention domain, which serves as a constraint for path replanning. The intention-domain prediction and path replanning problems are jointly formulated as a Markov Decision Process and solved through deep reinforcement learning. In addition, a Voronoi-based human trajectory generation algorithm is developed, allowing the model to be trained entirely in simulation without human participation or demonstration data. Extensive simulations and real-world user studies demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces operator workload and enhances safety, without compromising task efficiency compared with existing assistive teleoperation approaches.

Abstract: Autonomous driving holds transformative potential but remains fundamentally constrained by the limited perception and isolated decision-making with standalone intelligence. While recent multi-agent approaches introduce cooperation, they often focus merely on perception-level tasks, overlooking the alignment with downstream planning and control, or fall short in leveraging the full capacity of the recent emerging end-to-end autonomous driving. In this paper, we present UniMM-V2X, a novel end-to-end multi-agent framework that enables hierarchical cooperation across perception, prediction, and planning. At the core of our framework is a multi-level fusion strategy that unifies perception and prediction cooperation, allowing agents to share queries and reason cooperatively for consistent and safe decision-making. To adapt to diverse downstream tasks and further enhance the quality of multi-level fusion, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to dynamically enhance the BEV representations. We further extend MoE into the decoder to better capture diverse motion patterns. Extensive experiments on the DAIR-V2X dataset demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with a 39.7% improvement in perception accuracy, a 7.2% reduction in prediction error, and a 33.2% improvement in planning performance compared with UniV2X, showcasing the strength of our MoE-enhanced multi-level cooperative paradigm.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are set to transform robotic navigation, existing methods often underutilize their reasoning capabilities. To unlock the full potential of VLMs in robotics, we shift their role from passive observers to active strategists in the navigation process. Our framework outsources high-level planning to a VLM, which leverages its contextual understanding to guide a frontier-based exploration agent. This intelligent guidance is achieved through a trio of techniques: structured chain-of-thought prompting that elicits logical, step-by-step reasoning; dynamic inclusion of the agent's recent action history to prevent getting stuck in loops; and a novel capability that enables the VLM to interpret top-down obstacle maps alongside first-person views, thereby enhancing spatial awareness. When tested on challenging benchmarks like HM3D, Gibson, and MP3D, this method produces exceptionally direct and logical trajectories, marking a substantial improvement in navigation efficiency over existing approaches and charting a path toward more capable embodied agents.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), effective path planning has become increasingly important. Although traditional search methods have been extensively applied, metaheuristic algorithms have gained popularity due to their efficiency and problem-specific heuristics. However, challenges such as premature convergence and lack of solution diversity still hinder their performance in complex scenarios. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Enhanced Multi-Strategy Dwarf Mongoose Optimization (EDMO) algorithm, tailored for three-dimensional UAV trajectory planning in dynamic and obstacle-rich environments. EDMO integrates three novel strategies: (1) a Dynamic Quantum Tunneling Optimization Strategy (DQTOS) to enable particles to probabilistically escape local optima; (2) a Bio-phototactic Dynamic Focusing Search Strategy (BDFSS) inspired by microbial phototaxis for adaptive local refinement; and (3) an Orthogonal Lens Opposition-Based Learning (OLOBL) strategy to enhance global exploration through structured dimensional recombination. EDMO is benchmarked on 39 standard test functions from CEC2017 and CEC2020, outperforming 14 advanced algorithms in convergence speed, robustness, and optimization accuracy. Furthermore, real-world validations on UAV three-dimensional path planning and three engineering design tasks confirm its practical applicability and effectiveness in field robotics missions requiring intelligent, adaptive, and time-efficient planning.

Abstract: Decentralized collision avoidance remains a core challenge for scalable multi-robot systems. One of the promising approaches to tackle this problem is Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) -- a framework that is naturally suited to handle any robot motion model and provides strong theoretical guarantees. Still, in practice MPPI-based controller may provide suboptimal trajectories as its performance relies heavily on uninformed random sampling. In this work, we introduce CoRL-MPPI, a novel fusion of Cooperative Reinforcement Learning and MPPI to address this limitation. We train an action policy (approximated as deep neural network) in simulation that learns local cooperative collision avoidance behaviors. This learned policy is then embedded into the MPPI framework to guide its sampling distribution, biasing it towards more intelligent and cooperative actions. Notably, CoRL-MPPI preserves all the theoretical guarantees of regular MPPI. We evaluate our approach in dense, dynamic simulation environments against state-of-the-art baselines, including ORCA, BVC, and a multi-agent MPPI implementation. Our results demonstrate that CoRL-MPPI significantly improves navigation efficiency (measured by success rate and makespan) and safety, enabling agile and robust multi-robot navigation.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown strong potential for general-purpose robotic manipulation, but their reliance on expert demonstrations limits their ability to learn from failures and perform self-corrections. Reinforcement learning (RL) addresses these through self-improving interactions with the physical environment, but suffers from high sample complexity on real robots. We introduce World-Model-based Policy Optimization (WMPO), a principled framework for on-policy VLA RL without interacting with the real environment. In contrast to widely used latent world models, WMPO focuses on pixel-based predictions that align the "imagined" trajectories with the VLA features pretrained with web-scale images. Crucially, WMPO enables the policy to perform on-policy GRPO that provides stronger performance than the often-used off-policy methods. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-robot settings demonstrate that WMPO (i) substantially improves sample efficiency, (ii) achieves stronger overall performance, (iii) exhibits emergent behaviors such as self-correction, and (iv) demonstrates robust generalization and lifelong learning capabilities.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable success in improving robustness and generalization for end-to-end robotic manipulation. However, these models struggle with long-horizon tasks due to their lack of memory and reliance solely on immediate sensory inputs. To address this limitation, we propose Memory-Augmented Prompting for Vision-Language-Action model (MAP-VLA), a novel framework that empowers pre-trained VLA models with demonstration-derived memory prompts to augment action generation for long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks. To achieve this, MAP-VLA first constructs a memory library from historical demonstrations, where each memory unit captures information about a specific stage of a task. These memory units are implemented as learnable soft prompts optimized through prompt tuning. Then, during real-time task execution, MAP-VLA retrieves relevant memory through trajectory similarity matching and dynamically integrates it into the VLA model for augmented action generation. Importantly, this prompt tuning and retrieval augmentation approach operates as a plug-and-play module for a frozen VLA model, offering a lightweight and flexible solution to improve task performance. Experimental results show that MAP-VLA delivers up to 7.0% absolute performance gains in the simulation benchmark and 25.0% on real robot evaluations for long-horizon tasks, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: While Large Language Models have been used to produce interpretable stock forecasts, they mainly focus on analyzing textual reports but not historical price data, also known as Technical Analysis. This task is challenging as it switches between domains: the stock price inputs and outputs lie in the time-series domain, while the reasoning step should be in natural language. In this work, we introduce Verbal Technical Analysis (VTA), a novel framework that combine verbal and latent reasoning to produce stock time-series forecasts that are both accurate and interpretable. To reason over time-series, we convert stock price data into textual annotations and optimize the reasoning trace using an inverse Mean Squared Error (MSE) reward objective. To produce time-series outputs from textual reasoning, we condition the outputs of a time-series backbone model on the reasoning-based attributes. Experiments on stock datasets across U.S., Chinese, and European markets show that VTA achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy, while the reasoning traces also perform well on evaluation by industry experts.
