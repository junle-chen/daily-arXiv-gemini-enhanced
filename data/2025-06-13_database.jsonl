The scaling\nlaws and popularity of AI models lead to the deployment of incredibly powerful\nGPU clusters in commercial data centers. Compared to CPU-only solutions, these\nclusters deliver impressive improvements in per-node compute, memory bandwidth,\nand inter-node interconnect performance. In this paper, we study the problem of\nscaling analytical SQL queries on distributed clusters of GPUs, with the stated\ngoal of establishing an upper bound on the likely performance gains. To do so,\nwe build a prototype designed to maximize performance by leveraging ML/HPC best\npractices, such as group communication primitives for cross-device data\nmovements. This allows us to conduct thorough performance experimentation to\npoint our community towards a massive performance opportunity of at least\n60$\\times$. To make these gains more relatable, before you can blink twice, our\nsystem can run all 22 queries of TPC-H at a 1TB scale factor!"}

Lucani"], "title": "Not all those who drift are lost: Drift correction and calibration scheduling for the IoT", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.DB"], "comment": null, "summary": "Sensors provide a vital source of data that link digital systems with the\nphysical world. However, as sensors age, the relationship between what they\nmeasure and what they output changes. This is known as sensor drift and poses a\nsignificant challenge that, combined with limited opportunity for\nre-calibration, can severely limit data quality over time. Previous approaches\nto drift correction typically require large volumes of ground truth data and do\nnot consider measurement or prediction uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a\nprobabilistic sensor drift correction method that takes a fundamental approach\nto modelling the sensor response using Gaussian Process Regression. Tested\nusing dissolved oxygen sensors, our method delivers mean squared error (MSE)\nreductions of up to 90% and more than 20% on average. We also propose a novel\nuncertainty-driven calibration schedule optimisation approach that builds on\ntop of drift correction and further reduces MSE by up to 15.7%."}

At the\nsame time, data citation is essential for maintaining academic integrity,\nacknowledging contributions, validating research outcomes, and fostering\nscientific reproducibility. As a critical link, it connects scholarly\npublications with the datasets that drive scientific progress. This study\ninvestigates whether repository visibility influences data citation rates. We\nhypothesize that repositories with higher visibility, as measured by search\nengine metrics, are associated with increased dataset citations. Using OpenAlex\ndata and repository impact indicators (including the visibility index from\nSistrix, the h-index of repositories, and citation metrics such as mean and\nmedian citations), we analyze datasets in Social Sciences and Economics to\nexplore their relationship. Our findings suggest that datasets hosted on more\nvisible web domains tend to receive more citations, with a positive correlation\nobserved between web domain visibility and dataset citation counts,\nparticularly for datasets with at least one citation. However, when analyzing\ndomain-level citation metrics, such as the h-index, mean, and median citations,\nthe correlations are inconsistent and weaker. While higher visibility domains\ntend to host datasets with greater citation impact, the distribution of\ncitations across datasets varies significantly. These results suggest that\nwhile visibility plays a role in increasing citation counts, it is not the sole\nfactor influencing dataset citation impact. Other elements, such as dataset\nquality, research trends, and disciplinary norms, also contribute significantly\nto citation patterns."}

This literature review explores how modern event-driven and\nmicroservices-based architectures, particularly those leveraging Apache Kafka,\nSpring Boot, MongoDB, and Kubernetes are transforming retail and financial\nsystems. By systematically reviewing academic publications, technical white\npapers, and industry reports from recent years, this study synthesizes key\nthemes and implementation strategies. The analysis reveals that technologies\nlike Kafka and Spring Boot are instrumental in building low-latency,\nevent-driven applications that support real-time analytics and fraud detection,\nwhile MongoDB, when deployed on Kubernetes, ensures fault tolerance and high\navailability in inventory and transaction systems. Kubernetes itself plays a\ncrucial role in automating deployment and scaling of microservices. These\nfindings provide valuable insights for industry practitioners aiming to design\nscalable infrastructures, identify research opportunities in hybrid deployment\nmodels, and offer educators a foundation to integrate modern system\narchitectures into professional and technical communication training."}
