The Supporter assists the Seeker\nby transmitting a compressed representation of its local map under bandwidth\nconstraints to support the Seeker's path-planning task. We introduce a bit-rate\nmetric based on the expected binary codeword length to quantify communication\ncost. Using this metric, we formulate the compression design problem as a\nrate-distortion optimization problem that determines when to communicate, which\nregions of the map should be included in the compressed representation, and at\nwhat resolution (i.e., quantization level) they should be encoded. Our\nformulation allows different map regions to be encoded at varying quantization\nlevels based on their relevance to the Seeker's path-planning task. We\ndemonstrate that the resulting optimization problem is convex, and admits a\nclosed-form solution known in the information theory literature as reverse\nwater-filling, enabling efficient, low-computation, and real-time\nimplementation. Additionally, we show that the Seeker can infer the compression\ndecisions of the Supporter independently, requiring only the encoded map\ncontent and not the encoding policy itself to be transmitted, thereby reducing\ncommunication overhead. Simulation results indicate that our method effectively\nconstructs compressed, task-relevant map representations, both in content and\nresolution, that guide the Seeker's planning decisions even under tight\nbandwidth limitations.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "This paper focuses on path planning for robots, which is related to trajectory prediction.

Our approach is based on two key insights. First, the hand\nmotion in a human demonstration provides a useful prior for the robot's\nend-effector trajectory, which we can convert into a rough open-loop robot\nmotion trajectory via kinematic retargeting. Second, while this retargeted\nmotion captures the overall structure of the task, it may not align well with\nplausible robot actions in-context. To address this, we leverage a pre-trained\ngeneralist diffusion policy to modify the trajectory, ensuring it both follows\nthe human motion and remains within the distribution of plausible robot\nactions. Our approach avoids the need for online reinforcement learning or\npaired human-robot data, enabling robust adaptation to new tasks and scenes\nwith minimal manual effort. Experiments in both simulation and real-world\nsettings show that DemoDiffusion outperforms both the base policy and the\nretargeted trajectory, enabling the robot to succeed even on tasks where the\npre-trained generalist policy fails entirely.

However, current LLMs demonstrate limited 3D spatial reasoning ability,\nwhich restricts their ability to generate realistic and coherent 3D scenes.\nMeanwhile, image generation-based methods often suffer from constraints in\nviewpoint selection and multi-view inconsistencies.

VIPScene accepts both text and image prompts and\nseamlessly integrates video generation, feedforward 3D reconstruction, and\nopen-vocabulary perception models to semantically and geometrically analyze\neach object in a scene. This enables flexible scene synthesis with high realism\nand structural consistency. For more precise analysis, we further introduce\nFirst-Person View Score (FPVScore) for coherence and plausibility evaluation,\nutilizing continuous first-person perspective to capitalize on the reasoning\nability of multimodal large language models.
