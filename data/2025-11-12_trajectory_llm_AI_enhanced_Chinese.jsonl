ExpReS-VLA stores compact feature representations from the frozen vision backbone instead of raw image-action pairs, reducing memory usage by approximately 97 percent. During deployment, relevant past experiences are retrieved using cosine similarity and used to guide adaptation, while prioritized experience replay emphasizes successful trajectories. We also introduce Thresholded Hybrid Contrastive Loss, which enables learning from both successful and failed attempts. On the LIBERO simulation benchmark, ExpReS-VLA improves success rates from 82.6 to 93.1 percent on spatial reasoning tasks and from 61 to 72.3 percent on long-horizon tasks. On physical robot experiments with five manipulation tasks, it reaches 98 percent success on both seen and unseen settings, compared to 84.7 and 32 percent for naive fine-tuning.

At first, we theoretically establish SDS as a simplified instance of the Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge framework. We prove that SDS employs the reverse process of an Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge, which, under specific conditions (e.g., a Gaussian noise as one end), collapses to SDS's score function of the pre-trained diffusion model. Based upon this, we introduce Trajectory-Centric Distillation (TraCe), a novel text-to-3D generation framework, which reformulates the mathematically trackable framework of Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge to explicitly construct a diffusion bridge from the current rendering to its text-conditioned, denoised target, and trains a LoRA-adapted model on this trajectory's score dynamics for robust 3D optimization.

However, their reliability remains a challenge, especially in long-horizon tasks, since they often produce overconfident yet wrong outputs. Conformal Prediction (CP) has been leveraged to address this issue by wrapping LLM outputs into prediction sets that contain the correct action with a user-defined confidence. When the prediction set is a singleton, the planner executes that action; otherwise, it requests help from a user. This has led to LLM-based planners that can ensure plan correctness with a user-defined probability. However, as LLMs are trained in an uncertainty-agnostic manner, without awareness of prediction sets, they tend to produce unnecessarily large sets, particularly at higher confidence levels, resulting in frequent human interventions limiting autonomous deployment. To address this, we introduce CoFineLLM (Conformal Finetuning for LLMs), the first CP-aware finetuning framework for LLM-based planners that explicitly reduces prediction-set size and, in turn, the need for user interventions.

Most existing robotic multitask models rely on dense embeddings that entangle both object and background cues, raising concerns about both efficiency and interpretability. In contrast, we study object-relation-centric representations as a pathway to more structured, efficient, and explainable visuomotor control. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we introduce LIBERO+, a fine-grained benchmark dataset designed to enable and evaluate object-relation reasoning in robotic manipulation. Unlike prior datasets, LIBERO+ provides object-centric annotations that enrich demonstrations with box- and mask-level labels as well as instance-level temporal tracking, supporting compact and interpretable visuomotor representations. Second, we propose SlotVLA, a slot-attention-based framework that captures both objects and their relations for action decoding. It uses a slot-based visual tokenizer to maintain consistent temporal object representations, a relation-centric decoder to produce task-relevant embeddings, and an LLM-driven module that translates these embeddings into executable actions. Experiments on LIBERO+ demonstrate that object-centric slot and object-relation slot representations drastically reduce the number of required visual tokens, while providing competitive generalization. Together, LIBERO+ and SlotVLA provide a compact, interpretable, and effective foundation for advancing object-relation-centric robotic manipulation.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u5bf9\u8c61\u5173\u7cfb\u5d4c\u5165\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002\u867d\u7136\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u4e0d\u662f\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u901a\u5e38\u6d89\u53ca\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "keywords": ["robotic manipulation", "LLM", "action decoding", "visuomotor control"]}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}

Traditional navigation systems rely on expensive LiDARs that, while geometrically precise, are seman- tically unaware, they cannot distinguish a important document on an office floor from a harmless piece of litter, treating both as physically traversable. While advanced semantic segmentation exists, no prior work has successfully integrated this visual intelligence into a real-time path planner that is efficient enough for low-cost, embedded hardware. This paper presents a frame- work to bridge this gap, delivering context-aware navigation on an affordable robotic platform. Our approach centers on a novel, tight integration of a lightweight perception module with an online A* planner. The perception system employs a semantic segmentation model to identify user-defined visual constraints, enabling the robot to navigate based on contextual importance rather than physical size alone. This adaptability allows an operator to define what is critical for a given task, be it sensitive papers in an office or safety lines in a factory, thus resolving the ambiguity of what to avoid. This semantic perception is seamlessly fused with geometric data. The identified visual constraints are projected as non-geometric obstacles onto a global map that is continuously updated from sensor data, enabling robust navigation through both partially known and unknown environments. We validate our framework through extensive experiments in high-fidelity simulations and on a real-world robotic platform. The results demonstrate robust, real-time performance, proving that a cost- effective robot can safely navigate complex environments while respecting critical visual cues invisible to traditional planners.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u670d\u52a1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u907f\u969c\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46A*\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u5c5e\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e14\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u73af\u5883\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "keywords": ["path planning", "trajectory prediction", "A* planner", "semantic segmentation"]}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}

Existing approaches often rely on pre-segmented, within-activity data and overlook the physical layout of the environment, limiting their robustness in continuous, real-world deployments. In this paper, we propose MARAuder's Map, a novel framework for real-time activity recognition from raw, unsegmented sensor streams. Our method projects sensor activations onto the physical floorplan to generate trajectory-aware, image-like sequences that capture the spatial flow of human movement. These representations are processed by a hybrid deep learning model that jointly captures spatial structure and temporal dependencies. To enhance temporal awareness, we introduce a learnable time embedding module that encodes contextual cues such as hour-of-day and day-of-week. Additionally, an attention-based encoder selectively focuses on informative segments within each observation window, enabling accurate recognition even under cross-activity transitions and temporal ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world smart home datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines, offering a practical solution for real-time HAR in ambient sensor environments.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6d89\u53ca\u4e86\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5229\u7528\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u63d0\u5230\u4e86attention\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0etransformer\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u5173\u8054\u3002", "keywords": ["activity recognition", "trajectory-aware", "deep learning", "attention", "human movement"]}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}
