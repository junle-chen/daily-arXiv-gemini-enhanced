However, efficiently fine-tuning them for\ndownstream tasks with varying geometric controls remains underexplored. In this\nwork, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework ( GeoAda) that enables\nflexible and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for controlled generative tasks\nwithout modifying the original model architecture. GeoAda introduces a\nstructured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling\noperators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected pretrained model\nlayers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an\nequivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight\nadapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model's geometric consistency while\nmitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We theoretically prove that\nthe proposed adapters maintain SE(3)-equivariance, ensuring that the geometric\ninductive biases of the pretrained diffusion model remain intact during\nadaptation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of GeoAda across diverse\ngeometric control types, including frame control, global control, subgraph\ncontrol, and a broad range of application domains such as particle dynamics,\nmolecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation. Empirical\nresults show that GeoAda achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance\nwhile preserving original task accuracy, whereas other baselines experience\nsignificant performance degradation due to overfitting and catastrophic\nforgetting.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "The paper focuses on geometric diffusion models and efficient fine-tuning using equivariant adapters (GeoAda).
