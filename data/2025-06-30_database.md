Abstract: The study of the evolving phenomena in a domain helps to understand the relationships between entities at different points in time and predict future trends. These phenomena, often complex, can be represented using knowledge graphs, which have the capability to model heterogeneous data from multiple sources. Nowadays, a considerable amount of sources delivering periodic updates to knowledge graphs in various domains is openly available. The evolution of data is of interest to knowledge graph management systems, and therefore it is crucial to organize these constantly evolving data to make them easily accessible and exploitable for analyzes. In this article, we will present and formalize the condensed representation of these evolving graphs.

Abstract: Sorting is an essential operation in computer science with direct consequences on the performance of large scale data systems, real-time systems, and embedded computation. However, no sorting algorithm is optimal under all distributions of data. The new adaptive hybrid sorting paradigm proposed in this paper is the paradigm that automatically selects the most effective sorting algorithm Counting Sort, Radix Sort, or QuickSort based on real-time monitoring of patterns in input data. The architecture begins by having a feature extraction module to compute significant parameters such as data volume, value range and entropy. These parameters are sent to a decision engine involving Finite State Machine and XGBoost classifier to aid smart and effective in choosing the optimal sorting strategy. It implements Counting Sort on small key ranges, Radix Sort on large range structured input with low-entropy keys and QuickSort on general purpose sorting. The experimental findings of both synthetic and real life dataset confirm that the proposed solution is actually inclined to excel significantly by comparison in execution time, flexibility and the efficiency of conventional static sorting algorithms. The proposed framework provides a scalable, high perhaps and applicable to a wide range of data processing operations like big data analytics, edge computing, and systems with hardware limitations.

Abstract: The rise of massive networks across diverse domains necessitates sophisticated graph analytics, often involving sensitive data and raising privacy concerns. This paper addresses these challenges using local differential privacy (LDP), which enforces privacy at the individual level, where no third-party entity is trusted, unlike centralized models that assume a trusted curator. We introduce novel LDP algorithms for two fundamental graph statistics: k-core decomposition and triangle counting. Our approach leverages input-dependent private graph properties, specifically the degeneracy and maximum degree of the graph, to improve theoretical utility. Unlike prior methods, our error bounds are determined by the maximum degree rather than the total number of edges, resulting in significantly tighter guarantees. For triangle counting, we improve upon the work of Imola, Murakami, and Chaudhury~\cite{IMC21locally, IMC21communication}, which bounds error in terms of edge count. Instead, our algorithm achieves bounds based on graph degeneracy by leveraging a private out-degree orientation, a refined variant of Eden et al.'s randomized response technique~\cite{ELRS23, and a novel analysis, yielding stronger guarantees than prior work. Beyond theoretical gains, we are the first to evaluate local DP algorithms in a distributed simulation, unlike prior work tested on a single processor. Experiments on real-world graphs show substantial accuracy gains: our k-core decomposition achieves errors within 3x of exact values, far outperforming the 131x error in the baseline of Dhulipala et al.~\cite{DLRSSY22}. Our triangle counting algorithm reduces multiplicative approximation errors by up to six orders of magnitude, while maintaining competitive runtime.

Abstract: As data and knowledge expand rapidly, adopting systematic methodologies for ontology generation has become crucial. With the daily increases in data volumes and frequent content changes, the demand for databases to store and retrieve information for the creation of knowledge graphs has become increasingly urgent. The previously established Knowledge Acquisition and Representation Methodology (KNARM) outlines a systematic approach to address these challenges and create knowledge graphs. However, following this methodology highlights the existing challenge of seamlessly integrating Neo4j databases with the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Previous attempts to integrate data from Neo4j into an ontology have been discussed, but these approaches often require an understanding of description logics (DL) syntax, which may not be familiar to many users. Thus, a more accessible method is necessary to bridge this gap. This paper presents a user-friendly approach that utilizes Python and its rdflib library to support ontology development. We showcase our novel approach through a Neo4j database we created by integrating data from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Using this dataset, we developed a Python script that automatically generates the required classes and their axioms, facilitating a smoother integration process. This approach offers a practical solution to the challenges of ontology generation in the context of rapidly growing adverse drug event datasets, supporting improved drug safety monitoring and public health decision-making.
