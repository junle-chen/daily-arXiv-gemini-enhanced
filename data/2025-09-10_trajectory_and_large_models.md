Abstract: The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos. EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial, temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

Abstract: We address vision-language-driven indoor navigation to assist visually impaired individuals in reaching a target location using images and natural language guidance. Traditional navigation systems are ineffective indoors due to the lack of precise location data. Our approach integrates vision and language models to generate step-by-step navigational instructions, enhancing accessibility and independence. We fine-tune the BLIP-2 model with Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a manually annotated indoor navigation dataset. We propose an evaluation metric that refines the BERT F1 score by emphasizing directional and sequential variables, providing a more comprehensive measure of navigational performance. After applying LoRA, the model significantly improved in generating directional instructions, overcoming limitations in the original BLIP-2 model.

Abstract: Traffic demand prediction plays a critical role in intelligent transportation systems. Existing traffic prediction models primarily rely on temporal traffic data, with limited efforts incorporating human knowledge and experience for urban traffic demand forecasting. However, in real-world scenarios, traffic knowledge and experience derived from human daily life significantly influence precise traffic prediction. Such knowledge and experiences can guide the model in uncovering latent patterns within traffic data, thereby enhancing the accuracy and robustness of predictions. To this end, this paper proposes integrating structured temporal traffic data with textual data representing human knowledge and experience, resulting in a novel knowledge-guided cross-modal feature representation learning (KGCM) model for traffic demand prediction. Based on regional transportation characteristics, we construct a prior knowledge dataset using a large language model combined with manual authoring and revision, covering both regional and global knowledge and experiences. The KGCM model then learns multimodal data features through designed local and global adaptive graph networks, as well as a cross-modal feature fusion mechanism. A proposed reasoning-based dynamic update strategy enables dynamic optimization of the graph model's parameters, achieving optimal performance. Experiments on multiple traffic datasets demonstrate that our model accurately predicts future traffic demand and outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodological approach to financial time series analysis by combining causal discovery and uncertainty-aware forecasting. As a case study, we focus on four key U.S. macroeconomic indicators -- GDP, economic growth, inflation, and unemployment -- and we apply the LPCMCI framework with Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) to uncover dynamic causal relationships in quarterly data from 1970 to 2021. Our results reveal a robust unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP and highlight the limited connectivity of inflation, suggesting the influence of latent factors. Unemployment exhibits strong autoregressive dependence, motivating its use as a case study for probabilistic forecasting. Leveraging the Chronos framework, a large language model trained for time series, we perform zero-shot predictions on unemployment. This approach delivers accurate forecasts one and two quarters ahead, without requiring task-specific training. Crucially, the model's uncertainty-aware predictions yield 90\% confidence intervals, enabling effective anomaly detection through statistically principled deviation analysis. This study demonstrates the value of combining causal structure learning with probabilistic language models to inform economic policy and enhance forecasting robustness.

Abstract: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides evidence-based guidelines for cancer treatment. Translating complex patient presentations into guideline-compliant treatment recommendations is time-intensive, requires specialized expertise, and is prone to error. Advances in large language model (LLM) capabilities promise to reduce the time required to generate treatment recommendations and improve accuracy. We present an LLM agent-based approach to automatically generate guideline-concordant treatment trajectories for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our contributions are threefold. First, we construct a novel longitudinal dataset of 121 cases of NSCLC patients that includes clinical encounters, diagnostic results, and medical histories, each expertly annotated with the corresponding NCCN guideline trajectories by board-certified oncologists. Second, we demonstrate that existing LLMs possess domain-specific knowledge that enables high-quality proxy benchmark generation for both model development and evaluation, achieving strong correlation (Spearman coefficient r=0.88, RMSE = 0.08) with expert-annotated benchmarks. Third, we develop a hybrid approach combining expensive human annotations with model consistency information to create both the agent framework that predicts the relevant guidelines for a patient, as well as a meta-classifier that verifies prediction accuracy with calibrated confidence scores for treatment recommendations (AUROC=0.800), a critical capability for communicating the accuracy of outputs, custom-tailoring tradeoffs in performance, and supporting regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for clinically viable LLM-based guideline adherence systems that balance accuracy, interpretability, and regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs, providing a scalable pathway toward automated clinical decision support.

Abstract: We propose $\Delta L$ Normalization, a simple yet effective loss aggregation method tailored to the characteristic of dynamic generation lengths in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Recently, RLVR has demonstrated strong potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but a major challenge lies in the large variability of response lengths during training, which leads to high gradient variance and unstable optimization. Although previous methods such as GRPO, DAPO, and Dr. GRPO introduce different loss normalization terms to address this issue, they either produce biased estimates or still suffer from high gradient variance. By analyzing the effect of varying lengths on policy loss both theoretically and empirically, we reformulate the problem as finding a minimum-variance unbiased estimator. Our proposed $\Delta L$ Normalization not only provides an unbiased estimate of the true policy loss but also minimizes gradient variance in theory. Extensive experiments show that it consistently achieves superior results across different model sizes, maximum lengths, and tasks. Our code will be made public at https://github.com/zerolllin/Delta-L-Normalization.

Abstract: Modern transportation systems face significant challenges in ensuring road safety, given serious injuries caused by road accidents. The rapid growth of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has prompted new traffic designs that aim to optimize interactions among AVs. However, effective interactions between AVs remains challenging due to the absence of centralized control. Besides, there is a need for balancing multiple factors, including passenger demands and overall traffic efficiency. Traditional rule-based, optimization-based, and game-theoretic approaches each have limitations in addressing these challenges. Rule-based methods struggle with adaptability and generalization in complex scenarios, while optimization-based methods often require high computational resources. Game-theoretic approaches, such as Stackelberg and Nash games, suffer from limited adaptability and potential inefficiencies in cooperative settings. This paper proposes an Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT)-based framework for AV interactions that overcomes these limitations by utilizing a decentralized and adaptive strategy evolution mechanism. A causal evaluation module (CEGT) is introduced to optimize the evolutionary rate, balancing mutation and evolution by learning from historical interactions. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed CEGT outperforms EGT and popular benchmark games in terms of lower collision rates, improved safety distances, higher speeds, and overall better performance compared to Nash and Stackelberg games across diverse scenarios and parameter settings.

Abstract: This chapter extends the family of perception-informed gap-based local planners to dynamic environments. Existing perception-informed local planners that operate in dynamic environments often rely on emergent or empirical robustness for collision avoidance as opposed to performing formal analysis of dynamic obstacles. This proposed planner, dynamic gap, explicitly addresses dynamic obstacles through several steps in the planning pipeline. First, polar regions of free space known as gaps are tracked and their dynamics are estimated in order to understand how the local environment evolves over time. Then, at planning time, gaps are propagated into the future through novel gap propagation algorithms to understand what regions are feasible for passage. Lastly, pursuit guidance theory is leveraged to generate local trajectories that are provably collision-free under ideal conditions. Additionally, obstacle-centric ungap processing is performed in situations where no gaps exist to robustify the overall planning framework. A set of gap-based planners are benchmarked against a series of classical and learned motion planners in dynamic environments, and dynamic gap is shown to outperform all other baselines in all environments. Furthermore, dynamic gap is deployed on a TurtleBot2 platform in several real-world experiments to validate collision avoidance behaviors.

Abstract: Traditional online Model Predictive Control (MPC) methods often suffer from excessive computational complexity, limiting their practical deployment. Explicit MPC mitigates online computational load by pre-computing control policies offline; however, existing explicit MPC methods typically rely on simplified system dynamics and cost functions, restricting their accuracy for complex systems. This paper proposes TransMPC, a novel Transformer-based explicit MPC algorithm capable of generating highly accurate control sequences in real-time for complex dynamic systems. Specifically, we formulate the MPC policy as an encoder-only Transformer leveraging bidirectional self-attention, enabling simultaneous inference of entire control sequences in a single forward pass. This design inherently accommodates variable prediction horizons while ensuring low inference latency. Furthermore, we introduce a direct policy optimization framework that alternates between sampling and learning phases. Unlike imitation-based approaches dependent on precomputed optimal trajectories, TransMPC directly optimizes the true finite-horizon cost via automatic differentiation. Random horizon sampling combined with a replay buffer provides independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) training samples, ensuring robust generalization across varying states and horizon lengths. Extensive simulations and real-world vehicle control experiments validate the effectiveness of TransMPC in terms of solution accuracy, adaptability to varying horizons, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Autonomous driving has attracted great interest due to its potential capability in full-unsupervised driving. Model-based and learning-based methods are widely used in autonomous driving. Model-based methods rely on pre-defined models of the environment and may struggle with unforeseen events. Proximal policy optimization (PPO), an advanced learning-based method, can adapt to the above limits by learning from interactions with the environment. However, existing PPO faces challenges with poor training results, and low training efficiency in long sequences. Moreover, the poor training results are equivalent to collisions in driving tasks. To solve these issues, this paper develops an improved PPO by introducing the risk-aware mechanism, a risk-attention decision network, a balanced reward function, and a safety-assisted mechanism. The risk-aware mechanism focuses on highlighting areas with potential collisions, facilitating safe-driving learning of the PPO. The balanced reward function adjusts rewards based on the number of surrounding vehicles, promoting efficient exploration of the control strategy during training. Additionally, the risk-attention network enhances the PPO to hold channel and spatial attention for the high-risk areas of input images. Moreover, the safety-assisted mechanism supervises and prevents the actions with risks of collisions during the lane keeping and lane changing. Simulation results on a physical engine demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms benchmark algorithms in collision avoidance, achieving higher peak reward with less training time, and shorter driving time remaining on the risky areas among multiple testing traffic flow scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must navigate dynamically uncertain environments while balancing the safety and driving efficiency. This challenge is exacerbated by the unpredictable nature of surrounding human-driven vehicles (HVs) and perception inaccuracies, which require planners to adapt to evolving uncertainties while maintaining safe trajectories. Overly conservative planners degrade driving efficiency, while deterministic approaches may encounter serious issues and risks of failure when faced with sudden and unexpected maneuvers. To address these issues, we propose a real-time contingency trajectory optimization framework in this paper. By employing event-triggered online learning of HV control-intent sets, our method dynamically quantifies multi-modal HV uncertainties and refines the forward reachable set (FRS) incrementally. Crucially, we enforce invariant safety through FRS-based barrier constraints that ensure safety without reliance on accurate trajectory prediction of HVs. These constraints are embedded in contingency trajectory optimization and solved efficiently through consensus alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The system continuously adapts to the uncertainties in HV behaviors, preserving feasibility and safety without resorting to excessive conservatism. High-fidelity simulations on highway and urban scenarios, as well as a series of real-world experiments demonstrate significant improvements in driving efficiency and passenger comfort while maintaining safety under uncertainty.
