A key limitation of existing\nadversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation\nbudget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness\ncharacteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce\ninstance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static\napproximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon\nScheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial\nperturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates\nthree key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via\ngradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,\nand (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these\ncues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget\ndynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results\non CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both\nadversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon\nbaselines and prior adaptive methods.

Recent video\ngeneration models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of\ntransformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal\nmodeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video\nsuper-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision,\nwhich can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms.\nWhile recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using\nsmaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as\nrestricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment,\nwhich can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these\nissues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\\times$Temporal Transformer for\nReal-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual\naxial spatial$\\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and\ntemporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need\nfor motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a\ncohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR\nachieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task."}

This work aims to\nintroduce a novel pipeline for generating realistic synthetic data, by\nleveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF) to\ngenerate 3D assets of multiple different agricultural vehicles instead of using\ngeneric models. These assets are placed in a simulated environment, where the\npoint clouds are generated using a simulated LiDAR. This is a flexible approach\nthat allows changing the LiDAR specifications without incurring additional\ncosts. We evaluated the impact of synthetic data on segmentation models such as\nPointNet++, Point Transformer V3, and OACNN, by training and validating the\nmodels only on synthetic data. Remarkably, the PTv3 model had an mIoU of\n91.35\\%, a noteworthy result given that the model had neither been trained nor\nvalidated on any real data. Further studies even suggested that in certain\nscenarios the models trained only on synthetically generated data performed\nbetter than models trained on real-world data. Finally, experiments\ndemonstrated that the models can generalize across semantic classes, enabling\naccurate predictions on mesh models they were never trained on."}

In this work, we introduce UAV4D, a framework for enabling\nphotorealistic rendering for dynamic real-world scenes captured by UAVs.\nSpecifically, we address the challenge of reconstructing dynamic scenes with\nmultiple moving pedestrians from monocular video data without the need for\nadditional sensors. We use a combination of a 3D foundation model and a human\nmesh reconstruction model to reconstruct both the scene background and humans.\nWe propose a novel approach to resolve the scene scale ambiguity and place both\nhumans and the scene in world coordinates by identifying human-scene contact\npoints. Additionally, we exploit the SMPL model and background mesh to\ninitialize Gaussian splats, enabling holistic scene rendering. We evaluated our\nmethod on three complex UAV-captured datasets: VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, and\nOkutama-Action, each with distinct characteristics and 10~50 humans. Our\nresults demonstrate the benefits of our approach over existing methods in novel\nview synthesis, achieving a 1.5 dB PSNR improvement and superior visual\nsharpness."}

The system uses pointer-based\nin-situ interaction to transfer the valuable expertise of trained inspection\npersonnel directly into a machine learning (ML) training pipeline. Unlike\nconventional screen-based annotation methods, our system captures physical\ntrajectories and contours directly on the object, providing a more intuitive\nand efficient way to label data. The core technology uses calibrated, tracked\npointers to accurately record user input and transform these spatial\ninteractions into standardised annotation formats that are compatible with\nopen-source annotation software. Additionally, a simple projector-based\ninterface projects visual guidance onto the object to assist users during the\nannotation process, ensuring greater accuracy and consistency. The proposed\nconcept bridges the gap between human expertise and automated data generation,\nenabling non-IT experts to contribute to the ML training pipeline and\npreventing the loss of valuable training samples. Preliminary evaluation\nresults confirm the feasibility of capturing detailed annotation trajectories\nand demonstrate that integration with CVAT streamlines the workflow for\nsubsequent ML tasks.

While recent training-free approaches have made progress\nby leveraging pre-trained diffusion models, they typically rely on\ninversion-based techniques that map input videos into the latent space, which\noften leads to temporal inconsistencies and degraded structural fidelity. To\naddress this, we propose FlowDirector, a novel inversion-free video editing\nframework. Our framework models the editing process as a direct evolution in\ndata space, guiding the video via an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to\nsmoothly transition along its inherent spatiotemporal manifold, thereby\npreserving temporal coherence and structural details. To achieve localized and\ncontrollable edits, we introduce an attention-guided masking mechanism that\nmodulates the ODE velocity field, preserving non-target regions both spatially\nand temporally. Furthermore, to address incomplete edits and enhance semantic\nalignment with editing instructions, we present a guidance-enhanced editing\nstrategy inspired by Classifier-Free Guidance, which leverages differential\nsignals between multiple candidate flows to steer the editing trajectory toward\nstronger semantic alignment without compromising structural consistency.\nExtensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that FlowDirector achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency,\nand background preservation, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and\ncoherent video editing without inversion."}

Leveraging over 15,000 annotated\nstreet-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA\nand P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1\nscore of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated\nresident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies.\nBeyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions:\nfor instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously\nreducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically\ncontingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of\narchitectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing\nthe limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language\nrationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data\nwith socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with\nSDG 11.
