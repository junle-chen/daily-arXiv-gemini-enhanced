Our approach integrates\nthree components: (1) a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) that\nlearns a continuous model of the system's dynamics, (2) a Transformer that\ngenerates symbolic candidate invariants conditioned on the learned vector\nfield, and (3) a symbolic-numeric verifier that provides a strong numerical\ncertificate for the validity of these candidates. We test our framework on\ncanonical physical systems and show that it significantly outperforms baselines\nthat operate directly on trajectory data. This work demonstrates the robustness\nof a decoupled learn-then-search approach for discovering mathematical\nprinciples from imperfect data.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "The paper uses Neural ODEs and Transformers to learn the dynamics of a system from trajectory data and discover conservation laws. While it doesn't directly use large language models in the traditional sense, the use of Transformers and learning from trajectory data connects it to the relevant themes. The focus is more on system dynamics and scientific discovery than pure trajectory prediction, but the use of trajectory data is significant.", "keywords": ["trajectory data", "Neural ODE", "Transformer", "dynamics"]}}

This action, known as a Line\nBreak, is a critical indicator of offensive effectiveness and tactical\nperformance, yet previous studies have mainly focused on shots or goal\nopportunities rather than on how teams break the defensive line. In this study,\nwe develop a machine learning model to predict Line Breaks using event and\ntracking data from the 2023 J1 League season. The model incorporates 189\nfeatures, including player positions, velocities, and spatial configurations,\nand employs an XGBoost classifier to estimate the probability of Line Breaks.\nThe proposed model achieved high predictive accuracy, with an AUC of 0.982 and\na Brier score of 0.015. Furthermore, SHAP analysis revealed that factors such\nas offensive player speed, gaps in the defensive line, and offensive players'\nspatial distributions significantly contribute to the occurrence of Line\nBreaks. Finally, we found a moderate positive correlation between the predicted\nprobability of being Line-Broken and the number of shots and crosses conceded\nat the team level. These results suggest that Line Breaks are closely linked to\nthe creation of scoring opportunities and provide a quantitative framework for\nunderstanding tactical dynamics in football.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "The paper focuses on predicting 'Line Breaks' in football, which can be considered a type of action prediction or strategic movement prediction. While it doesn't directly use Large Language Models, the prediction task falls under the broader umbrella of trajectory/action prediction. The methods used, such as XGBoost and feature engineering based on player positions and velocities, are common in trajectory prediction research.", "keywords": ["action prediction", "trajectory prediction", "football", "player positions", "velocities"]}}
