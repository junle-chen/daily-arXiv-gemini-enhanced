However, in most cases, important data in companies is stored in\nRDBMS's, and so, it is necessary to extract graphs from relational databases to\nperform graph analysis. Most of the existing methods do not extract a\nuser-intended graph since it typically requires complex join query processing.\nWe propose an efficient graph extraction method, \\textit{ExtGraph}, which can\nextract user-intended graphs efficiently by hybrid query processing of outer\njoin and materialized view. Through experiments using the TPC-DS, DBLP, and\nIMDB datasets, we have shown that \\textit{ExtGraph} outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods up to by 2.78x in terms of graph extraction time."}

This\nresults in non-uniform cluster access patterns in modern disk-based vector\ndatabases. While existing approaches optimize individual queries, they overlook\nthe impact of cluster access patterns, failing to account for the locality\neffects of queries that access similar clusters. This oversight increases cache\nmiss penalty. To minimize the cache miss penalty, we propose CALL, a\ncontext-aware query grouping mechanism that organizes queries based on shared\ncluster access patterns. Additionally, CALL incorporates a group-aware\nprefetching method to minimize cache misses during transitions between query\ngroups and latency-aware cluster loading. Experimental results show that CALL\nreduces the 99th percentile tail latency by up to 33% while consistently\nmaintaining a higher cache hit ratio, substantially reducing search latency."}

Concepts such as the FAIR data principles (Findable,\nAccessible, Interoperable, Reusable) should be taught and applied in\nundergraduate studies already. Traditionally, research data from labs, theses,\nand internships were handwritten and stored in inaccessible formats such as\nPDFs, limiting reuse and machine learning applications. At RWTH Aachen\nUniversity, a fifth-semester lab course introduces students to the electronic\nlaboratory notebook (ELN) Chemotion, an open-source DFG-funded tool linked to\nthe national NFDI4Chem initiative. Students plan, document, and evaluate\nexperiments digitally, ensuring metadata and analysis are captured for\nlong-term reuse. Chemotion's intuitive interface and repository enable\nsustainable data sharing. To reinforce RDM, students receive a seminar and\naccess to online training videos with interactive Moodle elements.

Centralized repositories, though widely used, are\nvulnerable to single points of failure arising from cyberattacks, technical\nfaults, natural disasters, or funding and political uncertainties. This can\nlead to widespread data unavailability, data loss, integrity compromises, and\nsubstantial delays in critical research, ultimately impeding scientific\nprogress. Centralizing essential scientific resources in a single geopolitical\nor institutional hub is inherently dangerous, as any disruption can paralyze\ndiverse ongoing research. The rapid acceleration of data generation, combined\nwith an increasingly volatile global landscape, necessitates a critical\nre-evaluation of the sustainability of centralized models. Implementing\nfederated and decentralized architectures presents a compelling and\nfuture-oriented pathway to substantially strengthen the resilience of\nscientific data infrastructures, thereby mitigating vulnerabilities and\nensuring the long-term integrity of data. Here, we examine the structural\nlimitations of centralized repositories, evaluate federated and decentralized\nmodels, and propose a hybrid framework for resilient, FAIR, and sustainable\nscientific data stewardship. Such an approach offers a significant reduction in\nexposure to governance instability, infrastructural fragility, and funding\nvolatility, and also fosters fairness and global accessibility. The future of\nopen science depends on integrating these complementary approaches to establish\na globally distributed, economically sustainable, and institutionally robust\ninfrastructure that safeguards scientific data as a public good, further\nensuring continued accessibility, interoperability, and preservation for\ngenerations to come."}

Its adaptability makes\nit more suitable for analyzing real-world graphs where noise and imperfect data\nare common and the ideal clique model is often impractical. The problem of\nidentifying the maximum $ k $-plex (MKP, which is NP-hard) is gaining attention\nin fields such as social network analysis, community detection, terrorist\nnetwork identification, and graph clustering. Recent works have focused on\noptimizing the time complexity of MKP algorithms. The state-of-the-art has\nreduced the complexity from a trivial $ O^*(2^n) $ to $ O^*(c_k^n) $, with $\nc_k > 1.94 $ for $ k \\geq 3 $, where $ n $ denotes the vertex number. This\npaper investigates the MKP using two quantum models: gate-based model and\nannealing-based model. Two gate-based algorithms, qTKP and qMKP, are proposed\nto achieve $ O^*(1.42^n) $ time complexity. qTKP integrates quantum search with\ngraph encoding, degree counting, degree comparison, and size determination to\nfind a $ k $-plex of a given size; qMKP uses binary search to progressively\nidentify the maximum solution. Furthermore, by reformulating MKP as a quadratic\nunconstrained binary optimization problem, we propose qaMKP, the first\nannealing-based approximation algorithm, which utilizes qubit resources more\nefficiently than gate-based algorithms. To validate the practical performance,\nproof-of-principle experiments were conducted using the latest IBM gate-based\nquantum simulator and D-Wave adiabatic quantum computer. This work holds\npotential to be applied to a wide range of clique relaxations, e.g., $ n $-clan\nand $ n $-club."}

This task poses unique challenges, including the creation of\ntask-oriented memories, the effective utilization of temporal and location\ninformation within memories, and the ability to draw upon multiple memories to\nanswer a recall question. To address these challenges, we propose a\ncomprehensive pipeline, Pensieve, integrating memory-specific augmentation,\ntime- and location-aware multi-signal retrieval, and multi-memory QA\nfine-tuning.
