However, there remains a notable lack of\npublicly accessible, real-world datasets to support research in areas such as\nspace object maneuver behavior prediction and collision risk assessment. This\nstudy seeks to address this gap by collecting and curating a representative\ndataset of maneuvering behavior from Starlink satellites. The dataset\nintegrates Two-Line Element (TLE) catalog data with corresponding\nhigh-precision ephemeris data, thereby enabling a more realistic and\nmultidimensional modeling of space object behavior. It provides valuable\ninsights into practical deployment of maneuver detection methods and the\nevaluation of collision risks in increasingly congested orbital environments.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "This paper focuses on satellite orbit analysis and prediction, which falls under the umbrella of trajectory prediction. While it doesn't explicitly mention large language models, the prediction of satellite maneuvers can potentially benefit from or be integrated with large models for enhanced accuracy or efficiency. The core focus is on trajectory prediction in a specific domain (satellite orbits).", "keywords": ["trajectory prediction", "satellite orbit analysis", "maneuver behavior prediction", "collision risk assessment"]}}
