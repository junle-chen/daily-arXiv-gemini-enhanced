The recent results about\nalpha-acyclic schemas and annotated relations give rise to results about\nbeta-acyclic schemas and annotated relations, since a schema is beta-acyclic if\nand only if every sub-schema of it is alpha-acyclic. Here, we study\ngamma-acyclic schemas and annotated relations.

This contraction\nremoves bound variables by composing regular expressions or by promoting bound\nvariables to free ones. The minimum necessary number of promoted bound\nvariables gives the contraction width, which is a novel parameter specific to\nCRPQs. In the second stage, our algorithm evaluates the free-connex acyclic\nCRPQ and projects away the columns of the promoted bound variables.
