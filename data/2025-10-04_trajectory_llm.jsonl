Early-exit reduces latency by terminating inference at\nintermediate layers, yet its task-dependent nature limits generalization across\ndiverse scenarios. We observe that this limitation aligns with autonomous\ndriving: navigation systems can anticipate upcoming contexts (e.g.,\nintersections, traffic lights), indicating which tasks will be required. We\npropose Nav-EE, a navigation-guided early-exit framework that precomputes\ntask-specific exit layers offline and dynamically applies them online based on\nnavigation priors. Experiments on CODA, Waymo, and BOSCH show that Nav-EE\nachieves accuracy comparable to full inference while reducing latency by up to\n63.9%. Real-vehicle integration with Autoware Universe further demonstrates\nreduced inference latency (600ms to 300ms), supporting faster decision-making\nin complex scenarios. These results suggest that coupling navigation foresight\nwith early-exit offers a viable path toward efficient deployment of large\nmodels in autonomous systems.

This\nseverely constrains the foot's environmental interaction capability, hindering\ntasks such as ball kicking. This study innovatively adapts the spatial-temporal\ntrajectory planning method, which has been successful in drone applications, to\nbipedal robotic systems. The proposed approach autonomously generates foot\ntrajectories that satisfy constraints on target kicking position, velocity, and\nacceleration while simultaneously optimizing swing phase duration. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the optimized trajectories closely mimic human kicking\nbehavior, featuring a backswing motion.

As language models\ncontinue to improve in reasoning and planning, they provide a natural\nfoundation for such systems, reducing pilot workload by enabling high-level\ntask delegation through intuitive, language-based interfaces. In this paper we\npresent TACOS (Task-Agnostic COordinator of a multi-drone System), a unified\nframework that enables high-level natural language control of multi-UAV systems\nthrough Large Language Models (LLMs). TACOS integrates three key capabilities\ninto a single architecture: a one-to-many natural language interface for\nintuitive user interaction, an intelligent coordinator for translating user\nintent into structured task plans, and an autonomous agent that executes plans\ninteracting with the real-world. TACOS allows a LLM to interact with a library\nof executable APIs, bridging semantic reasoning with real-time multi-robot\ncoordination.

To address these issues, we propose\n4DGS-Craft, a consistent and interactive 4DGS editing framework. We first\nintroduce a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model to ensure both view and temporal\nconsistency. This model incorporates 4D VGGT geometry features extracted from\nthe initial scene, enabling it to capture underlying 4D geometric structures\nduring editing. We further enhance this model with a multi-view grid module\nthat enforces consistency by iteratively refining multi-view input images while\njointly optimizing the underlying 4D scene. Furthermore, we preserve the\nconsistency of non-edited regions through a novel Gaussian selection mechanism,\nwhich identifies and optimizes only the Gaussians within the edited regions.\nBeyond consistency, facilitating user interaction is also crucial for effective\n4DGS editing. Therefore, we design an LLM-based module for user intent\nunderstanding. This module employs a user instruction template to define atomic\nediting operations and leverages an LLM for reasoning. As a result, our\nframework can interpret user intent and decompose complex instructions into a\nlogical sequence of atomic operations, enabling it to handle intricate user\ncommands and further enhance editing performance.

Although most interactive imitation\nlearning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state,\nthey do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more\nhazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from\nHuman Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals\ncontained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The\nkey idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time\nsteps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent\nfollows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the\npreference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states,\nexpert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the\nagent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and\nreducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments\non both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate\nits efficiency and generality.
