Abstract: Dataset availability and quality remain critical challenges in machine learning, especially in domains where data are scarce, expensive to acquire, or constrained by privacy regulations. Fields such as healthcare, biomedical research, and cybersecurity frequently encounter high data acquisition costs, limited access to annotated data, and the rarity or sensitivity of key events. These issues-collectively referred to as the dataset challenge-hinder the development of accurate and generalizable machine learning models in such high-stakes domains. To address this, we introduce FlexiDataGen, an adaptive large language model (LLM) framework designed for dynamic semantic dataset generation in sensitive domains. FlexiDataGen autonomously synthesizes rich, semantically coherent, and linguistically diverse datasets tailored to specialized fields. The framework integrates four core components: (1) syntactic-semantic analysis, (2) retrieval-augmented generation, (3) dynamic element injection, and (4) iterative paraphrasing with semantic validation. Together, these components ensure the generation of high-quality, domain-relevant data. Experimental results show that FlexiDataGen effectively alleviates data shortages and annotation bottlenecks, enabling scalable and accurate machine learning model development.

Abstract: We investigate the fine-grained complexity of direct access to Conjunctive Query (CQ) answers according to their position, ordered by the minimum (or maximum) value between attributes. We further use the tools we develop to explore a wealth of related tasks. We consider the task of ranked enumeration under min/max orders, as well as tasks concerning CQs with predicates of the form x <= min X , where X is a set of variables and x is a single variable: counting, enumeration, direct access, and predicate elimination (i.e., transforming the pair of query and database to an equivalent pair without min-predicates). For each task, we establish a complete dichotomy for self-join-free CQs, precisely identifying the cases that are solvable in near-ideal time, i.e., (quasi)linear preprocessing time followed by constant or logarithmic time per output.

Abstract: We explore AI-driven distributed-systems policy design by combining stochastic code generation from large language models (LLMs) with deterministic verification in a domain-specific simulator. Using a Function-as-a-Service runtime (Bauplan) and its open-source simulator (Eudoxia) as a case study, we frame scheduler design as an iterative generate-and-verify loop: an LLM proposes a Python policy, the simulator evaluates it on standardized traces, and structured feedback steers subsequent generations. This setup preserves interpretability while enabling targeted search over a large design space. We detail the system architecture and report preliminary results on throughput improvements across multiple models. Beyond early gains, we discuss the limits of the current setup and outline next steps; in particular, we conjecture that AI will be crucial for scaling this methodology by helping to bootstrap new simulators.

Abstract: During the study, the results of a comparative analysis of the process of handling large datasets using the Apache Spark platform in Java, Python, and Scala programming languages were obtained. Although prior works have focused on individual stages, comprehensive comparisons of full ETL workflows across programming languages using Apache Iceberg remain limited. The analysis was performed by executing several operations, including downloading data from CSV files, transforming and loading it into an Apache Iceberg analytical table. It was found that the performance of the Spark algorithm varies significantly depending on the amount of data and the programming language used. When processing a 5-megabyte CSV file, the best result was achieved in Python: 6.71 seconds, which is superior to Scala's score of 9.13 seconds and Java's time of 9.62 seconds. For processing a large CSV file of 1.6 gigabytes, all programming languages demonstrated similar results: the fastest performance was showed in Python: 46.34 seconds, while Scala and Java showed results of 47.72 and 50.56 seconds, respectively. When performing a more complex operation that involved combining two CSV files into a single dataset for further loading into an Apache Iceberg table, Scala demonstrated the highest performance, at 374.42 seconds. Java processing was completed in 379.8 seconds, while Python was the least efficient, with a runtime of 398.32 seconds. It follows that the programming language significantly affects the efficiency of data processing by the Apache Spark algorithm, with Scala and Java being more productive for processing large amounts of data and complex operations, while Python demonstrates an advantage in working with small amounts of data. The results obtained can be useful for optimizing data handling processes depending on specific performance requirements and the amount of information being processed.

Abstract: In-memory key-value datastores have become indispensable building blocks of modern cloud-native infrastructures, yet their evolution faces scalability, compatibility, and sustainability constraints. The current literature lacks an experimental evaluation of state-of-the-art tools in the domain. This study addressed this timely gap by benchmarking Redis alternatives and systematically evaluating Valkey, KeyDB, and Garnet under realistic workloads within Kubernetes deployments. The results demonstrate clear trade-offs among the benchmarked data systems. Our study presents a comprehensive performance and viability assessment of the emerging in-memory key-value stores. Metrics include throughput, tail latency, CPU and memory efficiency, and migration complexity. We highlight trade-offs between performance, compatibility, and long-term viability, including project maturity, community support, and sustained development.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is important in modern large-scale systems and is applied in a variety of domains to analyze and monitor the operation of diverse systems. Unsupervised approaches have received widespread interest, as they do not require anomaly labels during training, thus avoiding potentially high costs and having wider applications. Among these, autoencoders have received extensive attention. They use reconstruction errors from compressed representations to define anomaly scores. However, representations learned by autoencoders are sensitive to anomalies in training time series, causing reduced accuracy. We propose a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm, where we decompose the encoded representation into stable and auxiliary representations, thereby enhancing the robustness when training with contaminated time series. In addition, we propose a novel mutual information based metric to replace the reconstruction errors for identifying anomalies. Our proposal demonstrates competitive or state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used multi- and univariate time series benchmarks and exhibits robustness to time series with different contamination ratios.
