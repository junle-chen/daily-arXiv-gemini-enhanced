Existing vector search and RAG\nsolutions largely assume abundant computation resources, making them\nimpractical for on-device scenarios. In this paper, we propose MobileRAG, a\nfully on-device pipeline that overcomes these limitations by combining a\nmobile-friendly vector search algorithm, \\textit{EcoVector}, with a lightweight\n\\textit{Selective Content Reduction} (SCR) method. By partitioning and\npartially loading index data, EcoVector drastically reduces both memory\nfootprint and CPU usage, while the SCR method filters out irrelevant text to\ndiminish Language Model (LM) input size without degrading accuracy. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrated that MobileRAG significantly outperforms conventional\nvector search and RAG methods in terms of latency, memory usage, and power\nconsumption, while maintaining accuracy and enabling offline operation to\nsafeguard privacy in resource-constrained environments."}

For instance, while there are numerous data science tools\navailable, developing a pipeline planning system to coordinate these tools\nremains challenging. This difficulty arises because existing Data+AI systems\nhave limited capabilities in semantic understanding, reasoning, and planning.\nFortunately, we have witnessed the success of large language models (LLMs) in\nenhancing semantic understanding, reasoning, and planning abilities. It is\ncrucial to incorporate LLM techniques to revolutionize data systems for\norchestrating Data+AI applications effectively.\n  To achieve this, we propose the concept of a 'Data Agent' - a comprehensive\narchitecture designed to orchestrate Data+AI ecosystems, which focuses on\ntackling data-related tasks by integrating knowledge comprehension, reasoning,\nand planning capabilities. We delve into the challenges involved in designing\ndata agents, such as understanding data/queries/environments/tools,\norchestrating pipelines/workflows, optimizing and executing pipelines, and\nfostering pipeline self-reflection. Furthermore, we present examples of data\nagent systems, including a data science agent, data analytics agents (such as\nunstructured data analytics agent, semantic structured data analytics agent,\ndata lake analytics agent, and multi-modal data analytics agent), and a\ndatabase administrator (DBA) agent. We also outline several open challenges\nassociated with designing data agent systems."}

Foremost among them is\nMedical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV), the world's largest\nopen-source EHR database. However, the inherent complexity of these datasets,\nparticularly the need for sophisticated querying skills and the need to\nunderstand the underlying clinical settings, often presents a significant\nbarrier to their effective use. M3 lowers the technical barrier to\nunderstanding and querying MIMIC-IV data. With a single command it retrieves\nMIMIC-IV from PhysioNet, launches a local SQLite instance (or hooks into the\nhosted BigQuery), and-via the Model Context Protocol (MCP)-lets researchers\nconverse with the database in plain English. Ask a clinical question in natural\nlanguage; M3 uses a language model to translate it into SQL, executes the query\nagainst the MIMIC-IV dataset, and returns structured results alongside the\nunderlying query for verifiability and reproducibility. Demonstrations show\nthat minutes of dialogue with M3 yield the kind of nuanced cohort analyses that\nonce demanded hours of handcrafted SQL and relied on understanding the\ncomplexities of clinical workflows. By simplifying access, M3 invites the\nbroader research community to mine clinical critical-care data and accelerates\nthe translation of raw records into actionable insight."}

However,\nexplaining the Shapley value of an owner in a data coalition is an unexplored\nand challenging task. To tackle this, we formulate the problem of finding the\ncounterfactual explanation of Shapley value in data coalitions. Essentially,\ngiven two data owners $A$ and $B$ such that $A$ has a higher Shapley value than\n$B$, a counterfactual explanation is a smallest subset of data entries in $A$\nsuch that transferring the subset from $A$ to $B$ makes the Shapley value of\n$A$ less than that of $B$. We show that counterfactual explanations always\nexist, but finding an exact counterfactual explanation is NP-hard. Using Monte\nCarlo estimation to approximate counterfactual explanations directly according\nto the definition is still very costly, since we have to estimate the Shapley\nvalues of owners $A$ and $B$ after each possible subset shift. We develop a\nseries of heuristic techniques to speed up computation by estimating\ndifferential Shapley values, computing the power of singular data entries, and\nshifting subsets greedily, culminating in the SV-Exp algorithm. Our\nexperimental results on real datasets clearly demonstrate the efficiency of our\nmethod and the effectiveness of counterfactuals in interpreting the Shapley\nvalue of an owner."}

It collects studies from the Web of Science\nCore Collection covering the period from 2013 to 2024.

These analyses involve keyword co -\noccurrence, clustering, burst term identification, as well as co - occurrence\nanalysis of authors and institutions. Microplastics can accumulate in soil,\ntransfer through food chains, and ultimately affect human health, making the\nresearch on them essential for effective pollution control. Focusing on the\ninternational research on the impacts of microplastics on soil and ecosystems,\nthe study reveals a steadily increasing trend in the number of publications\neach year, reaching a peak of 956 articles in 2024. A small number of highly\nproductive authors contribute significantly to the overall research output. The\nkeyword clustering analysis results in ten major clusters, including topics\nsuch as plastic pollution and microbial communities. The research on soil\nmicroplastics has evolved through three distinct stages: the preliminary\nexploration phase from 2013 to 2016, the expansion phase from 2017 to 2020, and\nthe integration phase from 2021 to 2024. For future research, multi - level\nassessments of the impacts of microplastics on soil ecosystems and organisms\nshould be emphasized, in order to fully uncover the associated hazards and\ndevelop practical solutions."}

By leveraging social connections\nand group behaviours, group recommendation (GR) aims to provide more accurate\nand engaging content to a set of users rather than individuals. Recently,\ninfluence-aware GR has emerged as a promising direction, as it considers the\nimpact of social influence on group decision-making. In earlier work, we\nproposed Influence-aware Group Recommendation (IGR) to solve this task.\nHowever, this task remains challenging due to three key factors: the large and\never-growing scale of social graphs, the inherently dynamic nature of influence\npropagation within user groups, and the high computational overhead of\nreal-time group-item matching.\n  To tackle these issues, we propose an Enhanced Influence-aware Group\nRecommendation (EIGR) framework. First, we introduce a Graph Extraction-based\nSampling (GES) strategy to minimise redundancy across multiple temporal social\ngraphs and effectively capture the evolving dynamics of both groups and items.\nSecond, we design a novel DYnamic Independent Cascade (DYIC) model to predict\nhow influence propagates over time across social items and user groups.\nFinally, we develop a two-level hash-based User Group Index (UG-Index) to\nefficiently organise user groups and enable real-time recommendation\ngeneration. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our\nproposed framework, EIGR, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines\nin both effectiveness and efficiency."}
