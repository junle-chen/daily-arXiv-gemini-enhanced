Abstract: Developing custom reasoning models via Reinforcement Learning (RL) that can incorporate organization-specific knowledge has great potential to address problems faced by enterprise customers. In many of these problems, the reward function is verifiable, a setting termed RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We apply RLVR to a popular data science benchmark called BIRD that measures the ability of an AI agent to convert a natural language query for a database to SQL executions. We apply a simple and general-purpose training recipe involving careful prompt and model selection, a warm-up stage using our offline RL approach called TAO, followed by rigorous online RLVR training. With no additional training data beyond the BIRD training set and no use of proprietary models, our very first submission to the BIRD leaderboard reached state-of-the-art accuracy on the private test set: 73.56% without self-consistency and 75.68% with self-consistency. In the latter case, our model also required fewer generations than the second-best approach. While BIRD is only a proxy task, the simplicity of our framework makes it broadly applicable to enterprise domains such as business intelligence, data science, and coding.

Abstract: We introduce QueryGym, an interactive environment for building, testing, and evaluating LLM-based query planning agents. Existing frameworks often tie agents to specific query language dialects or obscure their reasoning; QueryGym instead requires agents to construct explicit sequences of relational algebra operations, ensuring engine-agnostic evaluation and transparent step-by-step planning. The environment is implemented as a Gymnasium interface that supplies observations -- including schema details, intermediate results, and execution feedback -- and receives actions that represent database exploration (e.g., previewing tables, sampling column values, retrieving unique values) as well as relational algebra operations (e.g., filter, project, join). We detail the motivation and the design of the environment. In the demo, we showcase the utility of the environment by contrasting it with contemporary LLMs that query databases. QueryGym serves as a practical testbed for research in error remediation, transparency, and reinforcement learning for query generation. For the associated demo, see https://ibm.biz/QueryGym.

Abstract: Discretizing raw features into bucketized attribute representations is a popular step before sharing a dataset. It is, however, evident that this step can cause significant bias in data and amplify unfairness in downstream tasks.   In this paper, we address this issue by introducing the unbiased binning problem that, given an attribute to bucketize, finds its closest discretization to equal-size binning that satisfies group parity across different buckets. Defining a small set of boundary candidates, we prove that unbiased binning must select its boundaries from this set. We then develop an efficient dynamic programming algorithm on top of the boundary candidates to solve the unbiased binning problem.   Finding an unbiased binning may sometimes result in a high price of fairness, or it may not even exist, especially when group values follow different distributions. Considering that a small bias in the group ratios may be tolerable in such settings, we introduce the epsilon-biased binning problem that bounds the group disparities across buckets to a small value epsilon. We first develop a dynamic programming solution, DP, that finds the optimal binning in quadratic time. The DP algorithm, while polynomial, does not scale to very large settings. Therefore, we propose a practically scalable algorithm, based on local search (LS), for epsilon-biased binning. The key component of the LS algorithm is a divide-and-conquer (D&C) algorithm that finds a near-optimal solution for the problem in near-linear time. We prove that D&C finds a valid solution for the problem unless none exists. The LS algorithm then initiates a local search, using the D&C solution as the upper bound, to find the optimal solution.

Abstract: The article focuses on researching a system for processing and analyzing tracking data based on RFID technology to study the customer journey in retail. It examines the evolution of RFID technology, its key operating principles, and modern applications in retail that extend beyond logistics to include precise inventory management, loss prevention, and customer experience improvement. Particular attention is paid to the architecture for data collection, processing, and integration, specifically the ETL (extract, transform, load) methodology for transforming raw RFID and POS data into a structured analytical data warehouse. A detailed logical database model is proposed, designed for comprehensive analysis that combines financial sales metrics with behavioral patterns of customer movement. The article also analyzes the expected business benefits of RFID implementation through the lens of the Balanced Scorecard (BSC), which evaluates financial performance, customer satisfaction, and internal process optimization. It is concluded that the integration of tracking and transactional data creates a foundation for transforming retail into a precise, data-driven science, providing unprecedented visibility into physical product flows and consumer behavior.

Abstract: Clinicians are interested in better understanding complex diseases, such as cancer or rare diseases, so they need to produce and exchange data to mutualize sources and join forces. To do so and ensure privacy, a natural way consists in using a decentralized architecture and Federated Learning algorithms. This ensures that data stays in the organization in which it has been collected, but requires data to be collected in similar settings and similar models. In practice, this is often not the case because healthcare institutions work individually with different representations and raw data; they do not have means to normalize their data, and even less to do so across centers. For instance, clinicians have at hand phenotypic, clinical, imaging and genomic data (each individually collected) and want to better understand some diseases by analyzing them together. This example highlights the needs and challenges for a cooperative use of this wealth of information. We designed and implemented a framework, named I-ETL, for integrating highly heterogeneous healthcare datasets of hospitals in interoperable databases. Our proposal is twofold: (i) we devise two general and extensible conceptual models for modeling both data and metadata and (ii) we propose an Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) pipeline ensuring and assessing interoperability from the start. By conducting experiments on open-source datasets, we show that I-ETL succeeds in representing various health datasets in a unified way thanks to our two general conceptual models. Next, we demonstrate the importance of blending interoperability as a first-class citizen in integration pipelines, ensuring possible collaboration between different centers.

Abstract: Data visualization is essential for interpreting complex datasets, yet traditional tools often require technical expertise, limiting accessibility. VizGen is an AI-assisted graph generation system that empowers users to create meaningful visualizations using natural language. Leveraging advanced NLP and LLMs like Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Gemini 2.0 Flash, it translates user queries into SQL and recommends suitable graph types. Built on a multi-agent architecture, VizGen handles SQL generation, graph creation, customization, and insight extraction. Beyond visualization, it analyzes data for patterns, anomalies, and correlations, and enhances user understanding by providing explanations enriched with contextual information gathered from the internet. The system supports real-time interaction with SQL databases and allows conversational graph refinement, making data analysis intuitive and accessible. VizGen democratizes data visualization by bridging the gap between technical complexity and user-friendly design.
