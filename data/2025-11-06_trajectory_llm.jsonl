Understanding how agents\ncoordinate through memory is critical for natural language planning, where\niterative reasoning, constraint tracking, and error correction drive the\nsuccess. Inspired by working memory model in cognitive psychology, we present\nEvoMem, a multi-agent framework built on a dual-evolving memory mechanism. The\nframework consists of three agents (Constraint Extractor, Verifier, and Actor)\nand two memory modules: Constraint Memory (CMem), which evolves across queries\nby storing task-specific rules and constraints while remains fixed within a\nquery, and Query-feedback Memory (QMem), which evolves within a query by\naccumulating feedback across iterations for solution refinement. Both memory\nmodules are reset at the end of each query session.

During\ndisasters such as wildfires and hurricanes, human mobility patterns often\ndeviate from their normal states, which makes the task more challenging.\nHowever, existing works usually rely on limited data from a single city or\nspecific disaster, significantly restricting the model's generalization\ncapability in new scenarios. In fact, disasters are highly sudden and\nunpredictable, and any city may encounter new types of disasters without prior\nexperience. Therefore, we aim to develop a one-for-all model for mobility\ngeneration that can generalize to new disaster scenarios. However, building a\nuniversal framework faces two key challenges: 1) the diversity of disaster\ntypes and 2) the heterogeneity among different cities. In this work, we propose\na unified model for human mobility generation in natural disasters (named\nUniDisMob). To enable cross-disaster generalization, we design physics-informed\nprompt and physics-guided alignment that leverage the underlying common\npatterns in mobility changes after different disasters to guide the generation\nprocess. To achieve cross-city generalization, we introduce a meta-learning\nframework that extracts universal patterns across multiple cities through\nshared parameters and captures city-specific features via private parameters.\nExtensive experiments across multiple cities and disaster scenarios demonstrate\nthat our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving\nan average performance improvement exceeding 13%.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "The paper focuses on human mobility generation, which is related to trajectory prediction.
