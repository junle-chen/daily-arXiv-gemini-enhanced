Abstract: Traditional vehicle routing systems efficiently optimize singular metrics like time or distance, and when considering multiple metrics, they need more processes to optimize . However, they lack the capability to interpret and integrate the complex, semantic, and dynamic contexts of human drivers, such as multi-step tasks, situational constraints, or urgent needs. This paper introduces and evaluates PAVe (Personalized Agentic Vehicular Routing), a hybrid agentic assistant designed to augment classical pathfinding algorithms with contextual reasoning. Our approach employs a Large Language Model (LLM) agent that operates on a candidate set of routes generated by a multi-objective (time, CO2) Dijkstra algorithm. The agent evaluates these options against user-provided tasks, preferences, and avoidance rules by leveraging a pre-processed geospatial cache of urban Points of Interest (POIs). In a benchmark of realistic urban scenarios, PAVe successfully used complex user intent into appropriate route modifications, achieving over 88% accuracy in its initial route selections with a local model. We conclude that combining classical routing algorithms with an LLM-based semantic reasoning layer is a robust and effective approach for creating personalized, adaptive, and scalable solutions for urban mobility optimization.

Abstract: Multi-Agentic AI systems, powered by large language models (LLMs), are inherently non-deterministic and prone to silent failures such as drift, cycles, and missing details in outputs, which are difficult to detect. We introduce the task of anomaly detection in agentic trajectories to identify these failures and present a dataset curation pipeline that captures user behavior, agent non-determinism, and LLM variation. Using this pipeline, we curate and label two benchmark datasets comprising \textbf{4,275 and 894} trajectories from Multi-Agentic AI systems. Benchmarking anomaly detection methods on these datasets, we show that supervised (XGBoost) and semi-supervised (SVDD) approaches perform comparably, achieving accuracies up to 98% and 96%, respectively. This work provides the first systematic study of anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems, offering datasets, benchmarks, and insights to guide future research.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) can empower large language model (LLM) agents by enabling self-improvement through interaction, its practical adoption remains challenging due to costly rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable reward signals, and infrastructure complexity, all of which obstruct the collection of scalable experience data. To address these challenges, we introduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse experiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for autonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts, DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model that derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through step-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To improve the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an experience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and continuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent training. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new tasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online curriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent backbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in fully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready tasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in RL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only synthetic interactions. When transferring a policy trained purely on synthetic experiences to real-environment RL, DreamGym yields significant additional performance gains while requiring far fewer real-world interactions, providing a scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL.

Abstract: Sharing and reconstructing a consistent spatial memory is a critical challenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited bandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a multi-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information bottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to communicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a grid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization, emerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon this internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient communication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode partners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells (SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint uncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional resilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to 64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast baseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social representations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to social collective intelligence.

Abstract: We introduce GUI-360$^\circ$, a large-scale, comprehensive dataset and benchmark suite designed to advance computer-using agents (CUAs). CUAs present unique challenges and is constrained by three persistent gaps: a scarcity of real-world CUA tasks, the lack of automated collection-and-annotation pipelines for multi-modal trajectories, and the absence of a unified benchmark that jointly evaluates GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction.   GUI-360$^\circ$ addresses these gaps with an LLM-augmented, largely automated pipeline for query sourcing, environment-template construction, task instantiation, batched execution, and LLM-driven quality filtering. The released corpus contains over 1.2M executed action steps across thousands of trajectories in popular Windows office applications, and includes full-resolution screenshots, accessibility metadata when available, instantiated goals, intermediate reasoning traces, and both successful and failed action trajectories. The dataset supports three canonical tasks, GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction, and a hybrid GUI+API action space that reflects modern agent designs. Benchmarking state-of-the-art vision--language models on GUI-360$^\circ$ reveals substantial out-of-the-box shortcomings in grounding and action prediction; supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning yield significant gains but do not close the gap to human-level reliability. We release GUI-360$^\circ$ and accompanying code to facilitate reproducible research and accelerate progress on robust desktop CUAs.   The full dataset has been made public on https://huggingface.co/datasets/vyokky/GUI-360.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with partial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory level often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into conflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of abstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable synchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation unfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose candidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under consensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent independently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without revealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a shared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act. By reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids brittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world model capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and efficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic world model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and self-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient collaboration strategies.

Abstract: This study presents a complete pipeline for automated tennis match analysis. Our framework integrates multiple deep learning models to detect and track players and the tennis ball in real time, while also identifying court keypoints for spatial reference. Using YOLOv8 for player detection, a custom-trained YOLOv5 model for ball tracking, and a ResNet50-based architecture for court keypoint detection, our system provides detailed analytics including player movement patterns, ball speed, shot accuracy, and player reaction times. The experimental results demonstrate robust performance in varying court conditions and match scenarios. The model outputs an annotated video along with detailed performance metrics, enabling coaches, broadcasters, and players to gain actionable insights into the dynamics of the game.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction for autonomous driving has advanced rapidly, yet existing methods struggle with the joint challenges of sparse, non-overlapping camera views and complex scene dynamics. We present UniSplat, a general feed-forward framework that learns robust dynamic scene reconstruction through unified latent spatio-temporal fusion. UniSplat constructs a 3D latent scaffold, a structured representation that captures geometric and semantic scene context by leveraging pretrained foundation models. To effectively integrate information across spatial views and temporal frames, we introduce an efficient fusion mechanism that operates directly within the 3D scaffold, enabling consistent spatio-temporal alignment. To ensure complete and detailed reconstructions, we design a dual-branch decoder that generates dynamic-aware Gaussians from the fused scaffold by combining point-anchored refinement with voxel-based generation, and maintain a persistent memory of static Gaussians to enable streaming scene completion beyond current camera coverage. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that UniSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, while providing robust and high-quality renderings even for viewpoints outside the original camera coverage.

Abstract: Despite impressive high-level video comprehension, multimodal language models struggle with spatial reasoning across time and space. While current spatial training approaches rely on real-world video data, obtaining diverse footage with precise spatial annotations remains a bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we present SIMS-V -- a systematic data-generation framework that leverages the privileged information of 3D simulators to create spatially-rich video training data for multimodal language models. Using this framework, we investigate which properties of simulated data drive effective real-world transfer through systematic ablations of question types, mixes, and scales. We identify a minimal set of three question categories (metric measurement, perspective-dependent reasoning, and temporal tracking) that prove most effective for developing transferable spatial intelligence, outperforming comprehensive coverage despite using fewer question types. These insights enable highly efficient training: our 7B-parameter video LLM fine-tuned on just 25K simulated examples outperforms the larger 72B baseline and achieves competitive performance with proprietary models on rigorous real-world spatial reasoning benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates robust generalization, maintaining performance on general video understanding while showing substantial improvements on embodied and real-world spatial tasks.

Abstract: On-device AI agents offer the potential for personalized, low-latency assistance, but their deployment is fundamentally constrained by limited memory capacity, which restricts usable context. This reduced practical context window creates a trade-off between supporting rich, stateful interactions with complex tool capabilities and maintaining on-device feasibility. We break this trade-off with a framework for context-efficient on-device agents, driven by three synergistic optimizations (1) a dynamic memory system using specialized LoRA adapters to distill conversational history into a compressed, and structured Context State Object; (2) a minimalist serialization format for tool schemas to minimize token overhead per tool; and (3) a just-in-time schema-passing mechanism that loads full tool definitions only upon tool selection. We instantiate this framework by adapting a 3B parameter SLM to context-efficient trajectories and rigorously evaluate it against a conventional baseline on complex user tasks. Our agent matches, or exceeds, the performance of a conventional baseline while dramatically compressing context, achieving more than a 6-fold reduction in initial system prompt context and a 10- to 25-fold reduction in context growth rate based on the interaction verbosity, demonstrating that strategic context management is key to unlocking capable and persistent on-device AI.

Abstract: Access to trajectory data is a key requirement for developing and validating Air Traffic Management (ATM) solutions, yet many secondary and regional airports face severe data scarcity. This limits the applicability of machine learning methods and the ability to perform large-scale simulations or "what-if" analyses. In this paper, we investigate whether generative models trained on data-rich airports can be efficiently adapted to data-scarce airports using transfer learning. We adapt state-of-the-art diffusion- and flow-matching-based architectures to the aviation domain and evaluate their transferability between Zurich (source) and Dublin (target) landing trajectory datasets. Models are pretrained on Zurich and fine-tuned on Dublin with varying amounts of local data, ranging from 0% to 100%. Results show that diffusion-based models achieve competitive performance with as little as 5% of the Dublin data and reach baseline-level performance around 20%, consistently outperforming models trained from scratch across metrics and visual inspections. Latent flow matching and latent diffusion models also benefit from pretraining, though with more variable gains, while flow matching models show weaker generalization. Despite challenges in capturing rare trajectory patterns, these findings demonstrate the potential of transfer learning to substantially reduce data requirements for trajectory generation in ATM, enabling realistic synthetic data generation even in environments with limited historical records.

Abstract: Differentially private in-context learning (DP-ICL) has recently become an active research topic due to the inherent privacy risks of in-context learning. However, existing approaches overlook a critical component of modern large language model (LLM) pipelines: the similarity search used to retrieve relevant context data. In this work, we introduce a DP framework for in-context learning that integrates nearest neighbor search of relevant examples in a privacy-aware manner. Our method outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin across all evaluated benchmarks, achieving more favorable privacy-utility trade-offs. To achieve this, we employ nearest neighbor retrieval from a database of context data, combined with a privacy filter that tracks the cumulative privacy cost of selected samples to ensure adherence to a central differential privacy budget. Experimental results on text classification and document question answering show a clear advantage of the proposed method over existing baselines.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems remain brittle in rare, ambiguous, and out-of-distribution scenarios, where human driver succeed through contextual reasoning. Shared autonomy has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate such failures by incorporating human input when autonomy is uncertain. However, most existing methods restrict arbitration to low-level trajectories, which represent only geometric paths and therefore fail to preserve the underlying driving intent. We propose a unified shared autonomy framework that integrates human input and autonomous planners at a higher level of abstraction. Our method leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to infer driver intent from multi-modal cues -- such as driver actions and environmental context -- and to synthesize coherent strategies that mediate between human and autonomous control. We first study the framework in a mock-human setting, where it achieves perfect recall alongside high accuracy and precision. A human-subject survey further shows strong alignment, with participants agreeing with arbitration outcomes in 92% of cases. Finally, evaluation on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrates a substantial reduction in collision rate and improvement in overall performance compared to pure autonomy. Arbitration at the level of semantic, language-based representations emerges as a design principle for shared autonomy, enabling systems to exercise common-sense reasoning and maintain continuity with human intent.

Abstract: Effectively capturing the joint distribution of all agents in a scene is relevant for predicting the true evolution of the scene and in turn providing more accurate information to the decision processes of autonomous vehicles. While new models have been developed for this purpose in recent years, it remains unclear how to best represent the joint distributions particularly from the perspective of the interactions between agents. Thus far there is no clear consensus on how best to represent interactions between agents; whether they should be learned implicitly from data by neural networks, or explicitly modeled using the spatial and temporal relations that are more grounded in human decision-making. This paper aims to study various means of describing interactions within the same network structure and their effect on the final learned joint distributions. Our findings show that more often than not, simply allowing a network to establish interactive connections between agents based on data has a detrimental effect on performance. Instead, having well defined interactions (such as which agent of an agent pair passes first at an intersection) can often bring about a clear boost in performance.

Abstract: Large-scale disaster Search And Rescue (SAR) operations are persistently challenged by complex terrain and disrupted communications. While Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer a promising solution for tasks like wide-area search and supply delivery, yet their effective coordination places a significant cognitive burden on human operators. The core human-machine collaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an error-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a low-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a novel LLM-CRF system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to model and augment human-swarm teaming cognition. The proposed framework initially captures the operator's intention through natural and multi-modal interactions with the device via voice or graphical annotations. It then employs the LLM as a cognitive engine to perform intention comprehension, hierarchical task decomposition, and mission planning for the UAV swarm. This closed-loop framework enables the swarm to act as a proactive partner, providing active feedback in real-time while reducing the need for manual monitoring and control, which considerably advances the efficacy of the SAR task. We evaluate the proposed framework in a simulated SAR scenario. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional order and command-based interfaces, the proposed LLM-driven approach reduced task completion time by approximately $64.2\%$ and improved task success rate by $7\%$. It also leads to a considerable reduction in subjective cognitive workload, with NASA-TLX scores dropping by $42.9\%$. This work establishes the potential of LLMs to create more intuitive and effective human-swarm collaborations in high-stakes scenarios.

Abstract: Deploying autonomous robots that can learn new skills from demonstrations is an important challenge of modern robotics. Existing solutions often apply end-to-end imitation learning with Vision-Language Action (VLA) models or symbolic approaches with Action Model Learning (AML). On the one hand, current VLA models are limited by the lack of high-level symbolic planning, which hinders their abilities in long-horizon tasks. On the other hand, symbolic approaches in AML lack generalization and scalability perspectives. In this paper we present a new neuro-symbolic approach, GraSP-VLA, a framework that uses a Continuous Scene Graph representation to generate a symbolic representation of human demonstrations. This representation is used to generate new planning domains during inference and serves as an orchestrator for low-level VLA policies, scaling up the number of actions that can be reproduced in a row. Our results show that GraSP-VLA is effective for modeling symbolic representations on the task of automatic planning domain generation from observations. In addition, results on real-world experiments show the potential of our Continuous Scene Graph representation to orchestrate low-level VLA policies in long-horizon tasks.
