Sensorless 3D US, which uses deep\nlearning to estimate a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, is\na promising alternative. Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help\npredict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and\nanatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help\npredict its general shape. In prior approaches, global features are either\nignored or tightly coupled with local feature extraction, restricting the\nability to robustly model these two complementary aspects. We propose\nDualTrack, a novel dual-encoder architecture that leverages decoupled local and\nglobal encoders specialized for their respective scales of feature extraction.\nThe local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture\nfine-grained features, while the global encoder utilizes an image backbone\n(e.g., a 2D CNN or foundation model) and temporal attention layers to embed\nhigh-level anatomical features and long-range dependencies. A lightweight\nfusion module then combines these features to estimate the trajectory.\nExperimental results on a large public benchmark show that DualTrack achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy and globally consistent 3D reconstructions,\noutperforming previous methods and yielding an average reconstruction error\nbelow 5 mm.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "The paper discusses estimating a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, which falls under trajectory prediction.
