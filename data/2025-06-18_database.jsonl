However, they face challenges in\nunderstanding ambiguous phrasing, domain-specific vocabulary, and complex\nschema relationships. This paper introduces Datrics Text2SQL, a\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based framework designed to generate\naccurate SQL queries by leveraging structured documentation, example-based\nlearning, and domain-specific rules. The system builds a rich Knowledge Base\nfrom database documentation and question-query examples, which are stored as\nvector embeddings and retrieved through semantic similarity. It then uses this\ncontext to generate syntactically correct and semantically aligned SQL code.\nThe paper details the architecture, training methodology, and retrieval logic,\nhighlighting how the system bridges the gap between user intent and database\nstructure without requiring SQL expertise."}

Although tools like CPN Tools and CPN IDE excel at\nCPN-based simulation, they are often separate from modern data science\necosystems. Meanwhile, Python has become the de facto language for process\nmining, machine learning, and data analytics. In this paper, we introduce\nCPN-Py, a Python library that faithfully preserves the core concepts of Colored\nPetri Nets -- including color sets, timed tokens, guard logic, and hierarchical\nstructures -- while providing seamless integration with the Python environment.\nWe discuss its design, highlight its synergy with PM4Py (including stochastic\nreplay, process discovery, and decision mining functionalities), and illustrate\nhow the tool supports state space analysis and hierarchical CPNs. We also\noutline how CPN-Py accommodates large language models, which can generate or\nrefine CPN models through a dedicated JSON-based format."}

To\nsome extent, this adoption is due to the characteristics of customer workloads,\nwhich can be individually leveraged during the model training phase. However,\nthere is a gap between research and industry that impedes the development of\nrealistic learned components: the lack of suitable workloads. Existing ones,\nsuch as TPC-H and TPC-DS, and even more recent ones, such as DSB and CAB, fail\nto exhibit real workload patterns, particularly distribution shifts.\n  In this paper, we introduce Redbench, a collection of 30 workloads that\nreflect query patterns observed in the real world. The workloads were obtained\nby sampling queries from support benchmarks and aligning them with workload\ncharacteristics observed in Redset."}

With the diversity of structured and unstructured data in\nEHR, data visualization is an invaluable tool for managing and explaining these\ncomplexities. However, the scarcity of relevant medical visualization data and\nthe high cost of manual annotation required to develop such datasets pose\nsignificant challenges to advancing medical visualization techniques. To\naddress this issue, we propose an innovative approach using large language\nmodels (LLMs) for generating visualization data without labor-intensive manual\nannotation. We introduce a new pipeline for building text-to-visualization\nbenchmarks suitable for EMRs, enabling users to visualize EMR statistics\nthrough natural language queries (NLQs). The dataset presented in this paper\nprimarily consists of paired text medical records, NLQs, and corresponding\nvisualizations, forming the first large-scale text-to-visual dataset for\nelectronic medical record information called MedicalVis with 35,374 examples.\nAdditionally, we introduce an LLM-based approach called MedCodeT5, showcasing\nits viability in generating EMR visualizations from NLQs, outperforming various\nstrong text-to-visualization baselines. Our work facilitates standardized\nevaluation of EMR visualization methods while providing researchers with tools\nto advance this influential field of application. In a nutshell, this study and\ndataset have the potential to promote advancements in eliciting medical\ninsights through visualization."}

We use the observations from the\nanalysis to develop a machine learning framework to boost the (raw) performance\nof humans. Furthermore, we perform a preliminary study on how LLM performance\nis compared to humans indicating that it is typically better to consider a\ncombination of both.

We observed that a substantial amount of search and\nconstruction logs are generated throughout the lifespan of a graph-based index.\nHowever, these two types of valuable logs are not fully exploited due to the\nstatic nature of existing indexes. We present the EnhanceGraph framework, which\nintegrates two types of logs into a novel structure called a conjugate graph.\nThe conjugate graph is then used to improve search quality. Through theoretical\nanalyses and observations of the limitations of graph-based indexes, we propose\nseveral optimization methods. For the search logs, the conjugate graph stores\nthe edges from local optima to global optima to enhance routing to the nearest\nneighbor. For the construction logs, the conjugate graph stores the pruned\nedges from the proximity graph to enhance retrieving of k nearest neighbors.\nOur experimental results on several public and real-world industrial datasets\nshow that EnhanceGraph significantly improves search accuracy with the greatest\nimprovement on recall from 41.74% to 93.42%, but does not sacrifices search\nefficiency. In addition, our EnhanceGraph algorithm has been integrated into\nAnt Group's open-source vector library, VSAG."}

As currently implemented\nin production systems, sideways information passing enables only a\nuni-directional information flow, as opposed to instance-optimal algorithms,\nsuch as Yannakakis'. On the other hand, the latter require an additional pass\nover the input, which hinders adoption in production systems.\n  In this paper, we make a step towards enabling single-pass bi-directional\ninformation passing during query execution. We achieve this by statically\nanalyzing between which tables the information flow is blocked and by\nleveraging precomputed join-induced fingerprint columns on FK-tables. On the\nJOB benchmark, Parachute improves DuckDB v1.2's end-to-end execution time\nwithout and with semi-join filtering by 1.54x and 1.24x, respectively, when\nallowed to use 15% extra space."}

They also\nmanage to do more with less by applying scaling and optimization tricks for\ncomputing power conservation. This survey also offers a broader perspective on\nrecent advancements in LLMs going beyond isolated aspects such as model\narchitecture or ethical concerns. It categorizes emerging methods that enhance\nLLM reasoning, efficiency, and ethical alignment. It also identifies\nunderexplored areas such as interpretability, cross-modal integration and\nsustainability. With recent progress, challenges like huge computational costs,\nbiases, and ethical risks remain constant. Addressing these requires bias\nmitigation, transparent decision-making, and clear ethical guidelines.
