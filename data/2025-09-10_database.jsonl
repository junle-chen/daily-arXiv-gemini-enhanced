It begins by\nintroducing the foundational principles that underpin data space architectures,\nemphasizing their importance in facilitating secure and efficient data\nexchange. The core design principles and essential building blocks that form\nthe backbone of data-space systems are then examined. Several real-world\nimplementations are presented, showcasing how data spaces are applied across\nvarious industries to address challenges such as data sovereignty,\ninteroperability, and trust. The paper concludes by discussing future\ndirections, proposing that leveraging semantic data models can significantly\nenhance interoperability and data integration within data spaces. Furthermore,\nit suggests exploring the implementation of SPARQL as a sophisticated\nauthorization layer to improve security and granular control over data access.\nThis research provides a comprehensive understanding of the current state of\ndata spaces and aims to guide future advancements in this rapidly evolving\nfield by highlighting the potential of semantic data and SPARQL-based\nauthorization."}

A program that produces the counts of different queries often risks\nleaking sensitive individual-level information. A popular approach to enhance\ndata privacy is to return a noisy version of the actual count. It is typically\nachieved by adding independent noise to each query and then control the total\nprivacy budget within a period. This approach may be limited in the number of\nqueries and output accuracy in practice. Also, the returned counts do not\nmaintain the total order for nested queries, an important feature in many\napplications. This work presents the design and analysis of a new method,\nsigma-counting, that addresses these challenges. Sigma-counting uses the notion\nof sigma-algebra to construct privacy-preserving counting queries. We show that\nthe proposed concepts and methods can significantly improve output accuracy\nwhile maintaining a desired privacy level in the presence of massive queries to\nthe same data. We also discuss how the technique can be applied to address\nlarge and time-varying datasets."}

In practice, this\nlimits joinability across fragmented or inconsistently named tables. We propose\na fuzzy join framework that automatically identifies joinable column pairs and\ntraverses indirect (multi-hop) join paths across multiple databases. Our method\ncombines column name similarity with row-level fuzzy value overlap, computes\nedge weights using negative log-transformed Jaccard scores, and performs join\npath discovery via graph traversal. Experiments on synthetic healthcare-style\ndatabases demonstrate the system's ability to recover valid joins despite\nfuzzified column names and partial value mismatches. This research has direct\napplications in data integration."}

In recent years, many FANNS\nalgorithms have been proposed. However, the lack of a systematic investigation\nmakes it difficult to understand their relative strengths and weaknesses.\nAdditionally, we found that: (1) FANNS algorithms have coupled,\ndataset-dependent parameters, leading to biased comparisons. (2) Key impact\nfactors are rarely analyzed systematically, leaving unclear when each algorithm\nperforms well. (3) Disparate datasets, workloads, and biased experiment designs\nmake cross-algorithm comparisons unreliable. Thus, a comprehensive survey and\nbenchmark for FANNS is crucial to achieve the following goals: designing a fair\nevaluation and clarifying the classification of algorithms, conducting in-depth\nanalysis of their performance, and establishing a unified benchmark. First, we\npropose a taxonomy (dividing methods into \\textit{filter-then-search},\n\\textit{search-then-filter}, \\textit{hybrid-search}) and a systematic\nevaluation framework, integrating unified parameter tuning and standardized\nfiltering across algorithms to reduce implementation-induced performance\nvariations and reflect core trade-offs. Then, we conduct a comprehensive\nempirical study to analyze how query difficulty and dataset properties impact\nperformance, evaluating robustness under pressures like filter selectivity,\nRecall@k, and scalability to clarify each method's strengths. Finally, we\nestablish a standardized benchmark with real-world datasets and open-source\nrelated resources to ensure reproducible future research."}

This paper\npresents fresh insights into the theoretical foundation of these methods. We\ndescribe an algorithm to build a proximity graph for $(1+\\epsilon)$-ANN search\nthat has $O((1/\\epsilon)^\\lambda \\cdot n \\log \\Delta)$ edges and guarantees\n$(1/\\epsilon)^\\lambda \\cdot \\text{polylog }\\Delta$ query time. Here, $n$ and\n$\\Delta$ are the size and aspect ratio of the data input, respectively, and\n$\\lambda = O(1)$ is the doubling dimension of the underlying metric space. Our\nconstruction time is near-linear to $n$, improving the $\\Omega(n^2)$ bounds of\nall previous constructions. We complement our algorithm with lower bounds\nrevealing an inherent limitation of proximity graphs: the number of edges needs\nto be at least $\\Omega((1/\\epsilon)^\\lambda \\cdot n + n \\log \\Delta)$ in the\nworst case, up to a subpolynomial factor. The hard inputs used in our\nlower-bound arguments are non-geometric, thus prompting the question of whether\nimprovement is possible in the Euclidean space (a key subclass of metric\nspaces). We provide an affirmative answer by using geometry to reduce the graph\nsize to $O((1/\\epsilon)^\\lambda \\cdot n)$ while preserving nearly the same\nquery and construction time."}

The enhanced framework\nintegrates multiple map types, including choropleth, proportional symbol, small\nmultiples, and heatmaps, with linked statistical charts (e.g., scatter plots,\nboxplots) and time sliders, all within a coordinated-view environment.\nDropdown-based controls allow flexible, high-dimensional comparisons while\nmaintaining visual clarity.
