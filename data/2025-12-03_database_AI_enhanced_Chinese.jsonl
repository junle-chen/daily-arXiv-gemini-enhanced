In this approach, patterns are randomly drawn based on an interestingness measure, such as frequency or hyper-volume.

It uses a multi-step sampling procedure and addresses a key challenge in numerical data: accurately determining the number of interval patterns that cover each object. We extend this work with HFips, which samples interval patterns proportionally to both their frequency and hyper-volume. These methods efficiently tackle the well-known long-tail phenomenon in pattern sampling.

Despite the advantages, their schema-free nature poses major challenges for integration, exploration, visualization, and efficient querying. To bridge this gap, we present PG-HIVE, a novel framework for automatic schema discovery in property graphs. PG-HIVE goes beyond existing approaches by uncovering latent node and edge types, inferring property datatypes, constraints, and cardinalities, and doing so even in the absence of explicit labeling information. Leveraging a unique combination of Locality-Sensitive Hashing with property- and label-based clustering, PG-HIVE identifies structural similarities at scale. Moreover, it introduces incremental schema discovery, eliminating costly recomputation as new data arrives. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that PG-HIVE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, in both accuracy (by up to 65% for nodes and 40% for edges), and efficiency (up to 1.95x faster execution), unlocking the full potential of schema-aware property graph management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}

As a first step towards vertical integration of DuckDB and programmable SSDs, we consider whether and how DuckDB can access NVMe SSDs directly. By default, DuckDB relies on the POSIX file interface. In contrast, we rely on the xNVMe library and explore how it can be leveraged in DuckDB. We leverage the block-based nature of the DuckDB buffer manager to bypass the synchronous POSIX I/O interface, the file system and the block manager. Instead, we directly issue asynchronous I/Os against the SSD logical block address space. Our preliminary experimental study compares different ways to manage asynchronous I/Os atop xNVMe. The speed-up we observe over the DuckDB baseline is significant, even for the simplest scan query over a TPC-H table.

Identifying meaningful activities or situations (e.g., two objects coming closer) remains difficult and cannot be achieved by content extraction alone. Currently, Video Situation Analysis (VSA) is done manually with a human in the loop, which is error-prone and labor-intensive, or through custom algorithms designed for specific video types or situations. These algorithms are not general-purpose and require a new algorithm/software for each new situation or video from a new domain.\n  This report proposes a general-purpose VSA framework that overcomes the above limitations. Video contents are extracted once using state-of-the-art Video Content Extraction technologies. They are represented using two alternative models -- the extended relational model (R++) and graph models. When represented using R++, the extracted contents can be used as data streams, enabling Continuous Query Processing via the proposed Continuous Query Language for Video Analysis. The graph models complement this by enabling the detection of situations that are difficult or impossible to detect using the relational model alone. Existing graph algorithms and newly developed algorithms support a wide variety of situation detection. To support domain independence, primitive situation variants across domains are identified and expressed as parameterized templates. Extensive experiments were conducted across several interesting situations from three domains -- AL, CM, and SL-- to evaluate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed approach using a dataset of videos of varying lengths from these domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}
