Abstract: Relational databases are foundational to numerous domains, including business intelligence, scientific research, and enterprise systems. However, accessing and analyzing structured data often requires proficiency in SQL, which is a skill that many end users lack. With the development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology, the Text-to-SQL systems attempt to bridge this gap by translating natural language questions into executable SQL queries via an automated algorithm. Yet, when operating on complex real-world databases, the Text-to-SQL systems often suffer from ambiguity due to natural ambiguity in natural language queries. These ambiguities pose a significant challenge for existing Text-to-SQL translation systems, which tend to commit early to a potentially incorrect interpretation. To address this, we propose an interactive Text-to-SQL framework that models SQL generation as a probabilistic reasoning process over multiple candidate queries. Rather than producing a single deterministic output, our system maintains a distribution over possible SQL outputs and seeks to resolve uncertainty through user interaction. At each interaction step, the system selects a branching decision and formulates a clarification question aimed at disambiguating that aspect of the query. Crucially, we adopt a principled decision criterion based on Expected Information Gain to identify the clarification that will, in expectation, most reduce the uncertainty in the SQL distribution.

Abstract: Most recently, researchers have started building large language models (LLMs) powered data systems that allow users to analyze unstructured text documents like working with a database because LLMs are very effective in extracting attributes from documents. In such systems, LLM-based extraction operations constitute the performance bottleneck of query execution due to the high monetary cost and slow LLM inference. Existing systems typically borrow the query optimization principles popular in relational databases to produce query execution plans, which unfortunately are ineffective in minimizing LLM cost. To fill this gap, we propose QUEST, which features a bunch of novel optimization strategies for unstructured document analysis. First, we introduce an index-based strategy to minimize the cost of each extraction operation. With this index, QUEST quickly retrieves the text segments relevant to the target attributes and only feeds them to LLMs. Furthermore, we design an evidence-augmented retrieval strategy to reduce the possibility of missing relevant segments. Moreover, we develop an instance-optimized query execution strategy: because the attribute extraction cost could vary significantly document by document, QUEST produces different plans for different documents. For each document, QUEST produces a plan to minimize the frequency of attribute extraction. The innovations include LLM cost-aware operator ordering strategies and an optimized join execution approach that transforms joins into filters. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of QUEST, achieving 30%-6x cost savings while improving the F1 score by 10% -27% compared with state-of-the-art baselines.
