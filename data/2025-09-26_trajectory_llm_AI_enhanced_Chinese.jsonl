On the other\nhand, autonomous driving systems process complex scenes with numerous agents,\nregardless of whether they are pedestrians on a crosswalk or vehicles parked on\nthe side of the road. While attention mechanisms offer an implicit way to\nreduce the input to the elements that affect decisions, existing attention\nmechanisms for capturing agent interactions are quadratic, and generally\ncomputationally expensive. We propose RDAR, a strategy to learn per-agent\nrelevance -- how much each agent influences the behavior of the controlled\nvehicle -- by identifying which agents can be excluded from the input to a\npre-trained behavior model. We formulate the masking procedure as a Markov\nDecision Process where the action consists of a binary mask indicating agent\nselection. We evaluate RDAR on a large-scale driving dataset, and demonstrate\nits ability to learn an accurate numerical measure of relevance by achieving\ncomparable driving performance, in terms of overall progress, safety and\nperformance, while processing significantly fewer agents compared to a state of\nthe art behavior model.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "The paper focuses on autonomous driving, which inherently involves trajectory prediction.
