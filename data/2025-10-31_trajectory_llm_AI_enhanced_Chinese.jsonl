Despite\nrecent advances, language-driven navigation is still difficult, particularly\nfor UAVs in small-scale 3D environments. Existing Vision-Language Navigation\n(VLN) approaches are mostly designed for ground robots and struggle to\ngeneralize to aerial tasks that require full 3D spatial reasoning. The\nemergence of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as GPT and Claude,\nenables zero-shot semantic reasoning from visual and textual inputs. However,\nthese models lack spatial grounding and are not directly applicable to\nnavigation. To address these limitations, SoraNav is introduced, an adaptive\nUAV navigation framework that integrates zero-shot VLM reasoning with\ngeometry-aware decision-making. Geometric priors are incorporated into image\nannotations to constrain the VLM action space and improve decision quality. A\nhybrid switching strategy leverages navigation history to alternate between VLM\nreasoning and geometry-based exploration, mitigating dead-ends and redundant\nrevisits. A PX4-based hardware-software platform, comprising both a digital\ntwin and a physical micro-UAV, enables reproducible evaluation. Experimental\nresults show that in 2.5D scenarios, our method improves Success Rate (SR) by\n25.7% and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) by 17%.
