Abstract: The rise of graph analytics platforms has led to the development of various benchmarks for evaluating and comparing platform performance. However, existing benchmarks often fall short of fully assessing performance due to limitations in core algorithm selection, data generation processes (and the corresponding synthetic datasets), as well as the neglect of API usability evaluation. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel graph analytics benchmark. First, we select eight core algorithms by extensively reviewing both academic and industrial settings. Second, we design an efficient and flexible data generator and produce eight new synthetic datasets as the default datasets for our benchmark. Lastly, we introduce a multi-level large language model (LLM)-based framework for API usability evaluation-the first of its kind in graph analytics benchmarks. We conduct comprehensive experimental evaluations on existing platforms (GraphX, PowerGraph, Flash, Grape, Pregel+, Ligra and G-thinker). The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed benchmark.

Abstract: The past few years has witnessed specialized large language model (LLM) inference systems, such as vLLM, SGLang, Mooncake, and DeepFlow, alongside rapid LLM adoption via services like ChatGPT. Driving these system design efforts is the unique autoregressive nature of LLM request processing, motivating new techniques for achieving high performance while preserving high inference quality over high-volume and high-velocity workloads. While many of these techniques are discussed across the literature, they have not been analyzed under the framework of a complete inference system, nor have the systems themselves been analyzed and compared.   In this survey, we review these techniques, starting from operators and algorithms for request processing, then moving on to techniques for model optimization and execution, including kernel design, batching, and scheduling, before ending with techniques for memory management, including paged memory, eviction and offloading techniques, quantization, and cache persistence. Through these discussions, we show that these techniques fundamentally rely on load prediction, adaptive mechanisms, and cost reduction in order to overcome the challenges introduced by autoregressive generation and achieve the goals of the system. We then discuss how these techniques can be combined to form single-replica and multi-replica inference systems, including disaggregated inference systems that offer more control over resource allocation and serverless systems that can be deployed over shared hardware infrastructure. We end with a discussion of remaining challenges.

Abstract: Enterprise deployments of large-language model (LLM) demand continuously changing document collections with sub-second latency and predictable GPU cost requirements that classical Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines only partially satisfy. We present PentaRAG, a five-layer module that routes each query through two instant caches (fixed key-value and semantic), a memory-recall mode that exploits the LLM's own weights, an adaptive session memory, and a conventional retrieval-augmentation layer. Implemented with Mistral-8B, Milvus and vLLM, the system can answer most repeated or semantically similar questions from low-latency caches while retaining full retrieval for novel queries. On the TriviaQA domain, LoRA fine-tuning combined with the memory-recall layer raises answer similarity by approximately 8% and factual correctness by approximately 16% over the base model. Under a nine-session runtime simulation, cache warming reduces mean latency from several seconds to well below one second and shifts traffic toward the fast paths. Resource-efficiency tests show that PentaRAG cuts average GPU time to 0.248 seconds per query, roughly half that of a naive RAG baseline, and sustains an aggregate throughput of approximately 100,000 queries per second on our setup. These results demonstrate that a layered routing strategy can deliver freshness, speed, and efficiency simultaneously in production-grade RAG systems.

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) are widely regarded as the gold standard for storing structured information. Consequently, predictive tasks leveraging this data format hold significant application promise. Recently, Relational Deep Learning (RDL) has emerged as a novel paradigm wherein RDBs are conceptualized as graph structures, enabling the application of various graph neural architectures to effectively address these tasks. However, given its novelty, there is a lack of analysis into the relationships between the performance of various RDL models and the characteristics of the underlying RDBs.   In this study, we present REDELEX$-$a comprehensive exploration framework for evaluating RDL models of varying complexity on the most diverse collection of over 70 RDBs, which we make available to the community. Benchmarked alongside key representatives of classic methods, we confirm the generally superior performance of RDL while providing insights into the main factors shaping performance, including model complexity, database sizes and their structural properties.
