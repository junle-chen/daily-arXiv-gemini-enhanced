Recent studies have typically focused on fusing\ncross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models.\nHowever, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high\nmemory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired\nby the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we\nexplore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However,\ndirectly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative\ntransfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to\nspatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden\nstate updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for\nefficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear\ncomplexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to\nheterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a\ndomain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation\nspace into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and\nindependent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain\ndiscriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as\ndomain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate\nthe alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST.

While reinforcement learning (RL) can\nalleviate the data bottleneck by generating experience in simulation, it\ntypically relies on carefully designed, task-specific reward functions, which\nhinder scalability and generalization. Thus, contemporary works in dexterous\nmanipulation have often bootstrapped from reference trajectories. These\ntrajectories specify target hand poses that guide the exploration of RL\npolicies and object poses that enable dense, task-agnostic rewards. However,\nsourcing suitable trajectories - particularly for dexterous hands - remains a\nsignificant challenge. Yet, the precise details in explicit reference\ntrajectories are often unnecessary, as RL ultimately refines the motion. Our\nkey insight is that modern vision-language models (VLMs) already encode the\ncommonsense spatial and semantic knowledge needed to specify tasks and guide\nexploration effectively. Given a task description (e.g., \"open the cabinet\")\nand a visual scene, our method uses an off-the-shelf VLM to first identify\ntask-relevant keypoints (e.g., handles, buttons) and then synthesize 3D\ntrajectories for hand motion and object motion. Subsequently, we train a\nlow-level residual RL policy in simulation to track these coarse trajectories\nor \"scaffolds\" with high fidelity. Across a number of simulated tasks involving\narticulated objects and semantic understanding, we demonstrate that our method\nis able to learn robust dexterous manipulation policies.
