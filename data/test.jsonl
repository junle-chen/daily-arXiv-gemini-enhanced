A position paper examining the latent space\n  hypothesis - the proposition that diverse medical data can be represented in\n  shared latent spaces reflecting fundamental biological processes.

Although\nthese modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a\nsingle underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each\nobservation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold --\nmuch like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this\nlearned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a\npoint, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention\ncorresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a\nshared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions --\nsuch as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological\nentities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By\nrevealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the\nframework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis,\nlongitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away\nfrom grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each\nperson's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data\nscarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide --\nbut scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and\nperturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward."}

Unlike existing\nantibody evaluation strategies that rely on antibody alone and its similarity\nto natural ones (e.g., amino acid identity rate, structural RMSD), AbBiBench\nconsiders an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and\nevaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by\nmeasuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. We first curate,\nstandardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza,\nanti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain\nmutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein\nmodels including masked language models, autoregressive language models,\ninverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph\nmodels. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity\nvalues is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to\nincrease binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we\nevaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of\nnew antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural\nintegrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result,\nstructure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity\ncorrelation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified,\nbiologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of\nmore effective, function-aware antibody design models."}

These models usually entail homogeneity assumptions within\npatches and study networks of migration between patches to generate insights\ninto conservation of species, differentiation of populations, and persistence\nof infectious diseases. Here, focusing on infectious disease epidemiology, we\ntake a complementary approach and study the effects of individual variation\nwithin patches while neglecting any form of disease transmission between\npatches. Consistently with previous work on single populations, we show how\nmetapopulation models that neglect in-patch heterogeneity also underestimate\nbasic reproduction numbers ($\\mathcal{R}_{0}$) and the effort required to\ncontrol or eliminate infectious diseases by uniform interventions. We then go\nbeyond this confirmatory result and introduce a scheme to infer distributions\nof individual susceptibility or exposure to infection based on suitable\nstratifications of a population into patches. We apply the resulting\nmetapopulation models to a simple case study of the COVID-19 pandemic."}

Includes 3 boxes: Highlights,\n  Outstanding Questions box, Glossary", "summary": "Mobile genetic elements (e.g., endogenous viruses, LINEs, SINEs) can transfer\nbetween genomes, even between species, triggering dramatic genetic changes.\nEndogenous viral elements (EVEs) arise when infectious viruses integrate into\nthe host germline. EVEs integrate at specific sites; their genes or regulatory\nregions can be exapted and could induce chromosomal rearrangement. We propose\nthat EVEs participate in adaptive radiations and that their parent viruses,\nthrough interspecific transfer, could initiate new species formation. By\nsynchronously affecting multiple individuals, viral outbreaks generate shared\ngenomic changes that both facilitate reproductive isolation and provide the\nsimultaneous modifications needed for groups to emerge as founders of new\nspecies. We suggest horizontal viral transfer during the K-Pg accelerated\nmammalian radiation linking viral epidemics to macroevolutionary\ndiversification. This theoretical work proposes endogenous viruses as catalysts\nfor explosive speciation."}

Direct reciprocity, where\nactions are based on past encounters, is a key mechanism fostering cooperation.\nHowever, most studies assume synchronous decision-making, whereas real-world\ninteractions are often asynchronous, with individuals acting in sequence. This\nasynchrony can undermine standard cooperative strategies like Tit-for-Tat and\nWin-Stay Lose-Shift. To better understand cooperation in real-world contexts,\nit is crucial to explore the theory of direct reciprocity in asynchronous\ninteractions. To address this, we introduce a framework based on asynchronous\nstochastic games, incorporating asynchronous decisions and dynamic\nenvironmental feedback. We analytically derive the conditions under which\nstrategies form cooperative Nash equilibria. Our results demonstrate that the\norder of interactions can significantly alter outcomes: interaction asynchrony\ngenerally inhibits cooperation, except under specific conditions where\nenvironmental feedback effectively mitigates its negative impact. When\nenvironmental feedback is incorporated, a variety of stable reciprocal\nstrategies can be sustained. Notably, above a critical environmental threshold,\nany cooperative strategy can form a Nash equilibrium. Overall, our work\nunderscores the importance of interaction order in long-term evolutionary\nprocesses and highlights the pivotal role of environmental feedback in\nstabilizing cooperation in asynchronous interactions."}
