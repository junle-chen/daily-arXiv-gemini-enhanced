Yet,\nthis ambition exposes a dual challenge: reasoning jointly over structured,\nmulti-relational schemas and the semantic content of linked unstructured\nassets. To overcome this, we present DynaQuery - a unified, self-adapting\nframework that serves as a practical blueprint for next-generation \"Unbound\nDatabases.\" At the heart of DynaQuery lies the Schema Introspection and Linking\nEngine (SILE), a novel systems primitive that elevates schema linking to a\nfirst-class query planning phase. We conduct a rigorous, multi-benchmark\nempirical evaluation of this structure-aware architecture against the prevalent\nunstructured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm. Our results\ndemonstrate that the unstructured retrieval paradigm is architecturally\nsusceptible to catastrophic contextual failures, such as SCHEMA_HALLUCINATION,\nleading to unreliable query generation. In contrast, our SILE-based design\nestablishes a substantially more robust foundation, nearly eliminating this\nfailure mode. Moreover, end-to-end validation on a complex, newly curated\nbenchmark uncovers a key generalization principle: the transition from pure\nschema-awareness to holistic semantics-awareness. Taken together, our findings\nprovide a validated architectural basis for developing natural language\ndatabase interfaces that are robust, adaptable, and predictably consistent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}
