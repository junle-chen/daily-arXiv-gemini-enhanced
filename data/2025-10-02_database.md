Abstract: Translating natural language questions into SQL has become a core challenge in enabling non-technical users to query databases. While recent work has explored large-scale synthetic data generation to improve model performance through post-training, most efforts emphasize cross-domain generalization. This leaves a gap for real-world enterprise scenarios, where models need to specialize to a single database schema and organizations require to be able to evaluate their Text-to-SQL systems on their own databases. To address this, we introduce SING-SQL, a fully automated two-stage framework for generating high-quality, high-coverage synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any target database, without relying on SQL logs or manual annotations. Our approach hierarchically partitions a database schema into sub-schemas, synthesizes SQL queries across multiple complexity levels, and applies a quality-aware pipeline that includes LLM-as-a-judge validation, executability checks, automatic repair, and column balancing. We further release SingSQL-LM, a family of compact language models fine-tuned on the synthetic data, achieving strong in-domain generalization. On the subset of the BIRD benchmark, SingSQL-LM-3B-R64 reaches 82.87% Soft F1 and 73.03% EX upper bound with 32 candidates, outperforming the best 3B-scale baseline by +16.21 in Soft F1 and +12.36 in EX. At the 1.5B scale, SingSQL-LM-1.5B-R64 improves over prior systems by +9.30 in Soft F1 and +4.49 in EX. On synthetic evaluation sets, SingSQL-LMs exceed prior systems by wide margins, establishing state-of-the-art performance among open models at comparable scales. Our study of context management strategies reveals that schema-free fine-tuning combined with schema-only inference provides the most robust results. These findings establish SING-SQL as a scalable, database-agnostic paradigm for producing and evaluating enterprise-grade Text-to-SQL systems.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural language understanding and structured query generation (NL2SQL). However, extending these advances to GeoSQL tasks in the PostGIS environment remains challenging due to the complexity of spatial functions, geometric data types, and execution semantics. Existing evaluations primarily focus on general relational databases or Google Earth Engine code generation, leaving a lack of systematic benchmarks tailored to spatial databases. To address this gap, this study introduces GeoSQL-Eval, the first end-to-end automated evaluation framework for PostGIS query generation. Built upon Webb's Depth of Knowledge (DOK) model, the framework encompasses four cognitive dimensions, five proficiency levels, and twenty task categories, providing a comprehensive assessment of model performance in terms of knowledge acquisition, syntactic generation, semantic alignment, execution accuracy, and robustness. In parallel, we developed GeoSQL-Bench, a benchmark dataset comprising 14178 questions that span three task types, 340 PostGIS functions, and 82 domain-specific databases. Leveraging this framework, we systematically evaluated 24 representative models across six categories, applying entropy-weighting and statistical analyses to reveal differences in performance, error distributions, and resource consumption patterns. Furthermore, we established a public GeoSQL-Eval leaderboard that enables global research teams to conduct ongoing testing and comparison. These contributions not only extend the boundaries of NL2SQL applications but also provide a standardized, interpretable, and scalable framework for evaluating LLM performance in spatial database contexts, offering valuable insights for model optimization and applications in geographic information science, urban studies, and spatial analysis.

Abstract: This paper presents ActorDB ( Dekigoto ) , a novel database architecture that tightly integrates a single-writer actor model for writes, Incremental View Maintenance (IVM), and a zero-trust security model as a core component. The primary contribution of this work is the unification of these powerful but complex concepts into a single, cohesive system designed to reduce architectural complexity for developers of modern, data-intensive applications. We argue that by providing these capabilities out-of-the-box, ActorDB can offer a more robust, secure, and developer-friendly platform compared to solutions that require manual integration of separate systems for actor persistence, stream processing, and security. We present the core architecture, discuss the critical trade-offs in its design, and define the performance criteria for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to validate our approach.

Abstract: Error detection in relational databases is critical for maintaining data quality and is fundamental to tasks such as data cleaning and assessment. Current error detection studies mostly employ the multi-detector approach to handle heterogeneous attributes in databases, incurring high costs. Additionally, their data preprocessing strategies fail to leverage the variable-length characteristic of data sequences, resulting in reduced accuracy. In this paper, we propose an attribute-wise PAttern-perceptive Transformer (PAT) framework for error detection in relational databases. First, PAT introduces a learned pattern module that captures attribute-specific data distributions through learned embeddings during model training. Second, the Quasi-Tokens Arrangement (QTA) tokenizer is designed to divide the cell sequence based on its length and word types, and then generate the word-adaptive data tokens, meanwhile providing compact hyperparameters to ensure efficiency. By interleaving data tokens with the attribute-specific pattern tokens, PAT jointly learns shared data features across different attributes and pattern features that are distinguishable and unique in each specified attribute. Third, PAT visualizes the attention map to interpret its error detection mechanism. Extensive experiments show that PAT achieves excellent F1 scores compared to state-of-the-art data error detection methods. Moreover, PAT significantly reduces the model parameters and FLOPs when applying the compact QTA tokenizer.

Abstract: The FAIR Principles aim to make data and knowledge Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, yet current digital infrastructures often lack a unifying semantic framework that bridges human cognition and machine-actionability. In this paper, we introduce the Grammar of FAIR: a granular and modular architecture for FAIR semantics built on the concept of semantic units. Semantic units, comprising atomic statement units and composite compound units, implement the principle of semantic modularisation, decomposing data and knowledge into independently identifiable, semantically meaningful, and machine-actionable units. A central metaphor guiding our approach is the analogy between the hierarchy of level of organisation in biological systems and the hierarchy of levels of organisation in information systems: both are structured by granular building blocks that mediate across multiple perspectives while preserving functional unity. Drawing further inspiration from concept formation and natural language grammar, we show how these building blocks map to FAIR Digitial Objects (FDOs), enabling format-agnostic semantic transitivity from natural language token models to schema-based representations. This dual biological-linguistic analogy provides a semantics-first foundation for evolving cross-ecosystem infrastructures, paving the way for the Internet of FAIR Data and Services (IFDS) and a future of modular, AI-ready, and citation-granular scholarly communication.

Abstract: While high-dimensional embedding vectors are being increasingly employed in various tasks like Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Recommendation Systems, popular dimensionality reduction (DR) methods such as PCA and UMAP have rarely been adopted for accelerating the retrieval process due to their inability of preserving the nearest neighbor (NN) relationship among vectors. Empowered by neural networks' optimization capability and the bounding effect of Rayleigh quotient, we propose a Regularized Auto-Encoder (RAE) for k-NN preserving dimensionality reduction. RAE constrains the network parameter variation through regularization terms, adjusting singular values to control embedding magnitude changes during reduction, thus preserving k-NN relationships. We provide a rigorous mathematical analysis demonstrating that regularization establishes an upper bound on the norm distortion rate of transformed vectors, thereby offering provable guarantees for k-NN preservation. With modest training overhead, RAE achieves superior k-NN recall compared to existing DR approaches while maintaining fast retrieval efficiency.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS), as the core of vector databases (VectorDBs), has become widely used in modern AI and ML systems, powering applications from information retrieval to bio-informatics. While graph-based ANNS methods achieve high query efficiency, their scalability is constrained by the available host memory. Recent disk-based ANNS approaches mitigate memory usage by offloading data to Solid-State Drives (SSDs). However, they still suffer from issues such as long I/O traversal path, misalignment with storage I/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, leading to significant I/O latency and ultimately limiting scalability for large-scale vector search.   In this paper, we propose PageANN, a disk-based approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) framework designed for high performance and scalability. PageANN introduces a page-node graph structure that aligns logical graph nodes with physical SSD pages, thereby shortening I/O traversal paths and reducing I/O operations. Specifically, similar vectors are clustered into page nodes, and a co-designed disk data layout leverages this structure with a merging technique to store only representative vectors and topology information, avoiding unnecessary reads. To further improve efficiency, we design a memory management strategy that combines lightweight indexing with coordinated memory-disk data allocation, maximizing host memory utilization while minimizing query latency and storage overhead. Experimental results show that PageANN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) disk-based ANNS methods, achieving 1.85x-10.83x higher throughput and 51.7%-91.9% lower latency across different datasets and memory budgets, while maintaining comparable high recall accuracy.
