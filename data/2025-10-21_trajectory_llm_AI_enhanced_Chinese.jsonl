We introduce VDRive, a novel pipeline for end-to-end autonomous driving\nthat explicitly models state-action mapping to address these challenges,\nenabling interpretable and robust decision making. By leveraging the\nadvancement of the state understanding of the Vision Language Action Model\n(VLA) with generative diffusion policy-based action head, our VDRive guides the\ndriving contextually and geometrically. Contextually, VLA predicts future\nobservations through token generation pre-training, where the observations are\nrepresented as discrete codes by a Conditional Vector Quantized Variational\nAutoencoder (CVQ-VAE). Geometrically, we perform reinforcement learning\nfine-tuning of the VLA to predict future trajectories and actions based on\ncurrent driving conditions. VLA supplies the current state tokens and predicted\nstate tokens for the action policy head to generate hierarchical actions and\ntrajectories. During policy training, a learned critic evaluates the actions\ngenerated by the policy and provides gradient-based feedback, forming an\nactor-critic framework that enables a reinforcement-based policy learning\npipeline. Experiments show that our VDRive achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and nuScenes open-loop\nplanning.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.8, "explanation": "This paper is highly relevant as it combines elements of both trajectory prediction (future trajectories and actions based on current driving conditions) and large models (Vision Language Action Model - VLA).

Prior work shows that adding localized text control\nsignals, such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks, can help. However, these\nmethods struggle in complex scenarios and degrade in multi-object settings,\noffering limited precision and lacking a clear correspondence between\nindividual trajectories and visual entities as the number of controllable\nobjects increases. We introduce Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT), a framework\nthat conditions video generation on trajectories paired with localized text\ndescriptions. We propose Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) to integrate\nthese signals and adopt a dual-CFG scheme to separately modulate local and\nglobal text guidance. In addition, we develop a data processing pipeline that\nproduces trajectories with localized descriptions of tracked entities, and we\nannotate two million high quality video clips to train TGT. Together, these\ncomponents enable TGT to use point trajectories as intuitive motion handles,\npairing each trajectory with text to control both appearance and motion.\nExtensive experiments show that TGT achieves higher visual quality, more\naccurate text alignment, and improved motion controllability compared with\nprior approaches.

Real-world environments are complex and dynamic, governed by\ntask-specific rules and stochasticity, which makes it difficult for LLMs to\nground their internal knowledge in those dynamics. Under such OOD conditions,\nvanilla RL training often fails to scale; we observe Pass@k--the probability\nthat at least one of (k) sampled trajectories succeeds--drops markedly across\ntraining steps, indicating brittle exploration and limited generalization.\nInspired by model-based reinforcement learning, we hypothesize that equipping\nLLM agents with an internal world model can better align reasoning with\nenvironmental dynamics and improve decision-making. We show how to encode this\nworld model by decomposing it into two components: state representation and\ntransition modeling. Building on this, we introduce SPA, a simple reinforcement\nlearning framework that cold-starts the policy via a Self-Play supervised\nfinetuning (SFT) stage to learn the world model by interacting with the\nenvironment, then uses it to simulate future states prior to policy\noptimization. This simple initialization outperforms the online world-modeling\nbaseline and greatly boosts the RL-based agent training performance.\nExperiments across diverse environments like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku\nshow that our approach significantly improves performance. For example, SPA\nboosts the Sokoban success rate from 25.6% to 59.8% and raises the FrozenLake\nscore from 22.1% to 70.9% for the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model.", "relevance_analysis": {"relevance_score": 0.6, "explanation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u5fae\u8c03\u6765\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u6d89\u53ca\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u63d0\u5347agent\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u89c4\u5212\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u660e\u786e\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86Large Language Models (LLMs)\u3002", "keywords": ["Large Language Models", "LLMs", "reinforcement learning", "agent", "world model", "decision-making"]}, "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fbe\u5230API\u914d\u989d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u518d\u8bd5", "motivation": "Error: API quota exceeded", "method": "Error: API quota exceeded", "result": "Error: API quota exceeded", "conclusion": "\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6216\u7b49\u5f85\u660e\u5929API\u914d\u989d\u91cd\u7f6e\u3002"}}

Recently, there has been a growing\nshift towards tighter integration of these components, known as Integrated\nPrediction and Planning (IPP), with the aim of enabling more informed and\nadaptive decision-making. However, it remains unclear to what extent this\nintegration actually improves planning performance. In this work, we\ninvestigate the role of prediction in IPP approaches, drawing on the widely\nadopted Val14 benchmark, which encompasses more common driving scenarios with\nrelatively low interaction complexity, and the interPlan benchmark, which\nincludes highly interactive and out-of-distribution driving situations. Our\nanalysis reveals that even access to perfect future predictions does not lead\nto better planning outcomes, indicating that current IPP methods often fail to\nfully exploit future behavior information. Instead, we focus on high-quality\nproposal generation, while using predictions primarily for collision checks. We\nfind that many imitation learning-based planners struggle to generate realistic\nand plausible proposals, performing worse than PDM - a simple lane-following\napproach. Motivated by this observation, we build on PDM with an enhanced\nproposal generation method, shifting the emphasis towards producing diverse but\nrealistic and high-quality proposals.
