However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the\nsafety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to\nuncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this\nwork, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk\nprediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing\nhigh-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based\nmotion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle,\nother vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize\nplug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call\nDriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation\nframework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel\ninformation injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and\ntrajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial\nrelationships between motion waypoints and the environment.
